The highly anticipated event draws not only local riders but also a wave of overseas athletes who call Queenstown home during the off-season. It\u2019s a continued celebration of Kelly McGarry\u2019s enduring legacy that has inspired many riders of all ages to ride more and push their own progression. The idea of the McGazza Festival as a whole is to live a weekend like Kelly lived his life. Ride what he liked to ride, listen to the music he liked, and make the most of every moment just like he did. Whether you know of Kelly or not, the weekend gives riders the platform to elevate their skills and to learn from some of the best riders in the world while still keeping to Kelly\u2019s relaxed outlook on life. The McGazza Dream Jam is a showcase of the culture that Kelly embodied and inspired. This year\u2019s addition of an under 19\u2019s category to open for the main event allowed the highly talented and up-and-coming groms to showcase what the future holds for the sport. The crowd was also treated to a star-studded main event with the likes of Jackson Goldstone, Laurie Greenland, and Asa Vermette. Not to mention, Kiwi free-riders Conor Mcfarlane and Robin Goomes were also throwing down. Next year marks 10 years since Kelly\u2019s passing, and event organizers are already gearing up for a big one! A full trip down memory lane to showcase why Kelly is still such a special part of this community. Mcgazza Forever! Kelly still really inspires me. His attitude toward life and his willingness to help others and have the best time doing it makes me want to keep running this event for as long as\u00a0possible. \u2014 Emmerson\u00a0Wilken Celebrating the legacy of Kelly McGarry. Inspiring to see the next generation following in Kelly's legacy. Noah Evens boosting to the moon! Camden Rutherfurd showing that he is one of the most stylish up-and-coming riders. While having as much fun in the process. Imagine growing up with Dream Track in your backyard. Local ripper Reece Everett is no stranger to Dream Track. Throwing huge whips at only 14 years old. Watch the space, the groms are coming! A quick refresh before the adult's session. Jim Monro firing out of the gate. Jacob O'Donoghue-Price floating over the line up of riders. Tyler Brooker shining in all white. Asa Vermette in the house. Robin Goomes' huge backflip had the crowd on their feet. Conor Macfarlane with a head-turning dumped 360. You just can't teach style. Asa in full control. Rudi Eichhorn with one of the biggest backflips of the night. Gareth Burgess likes what he sees. Billy Spurway's trademark steeze. No complaints here. Flame on! Fritz fulling dumped, followed this up with a backflip Superman! Win some, lose most. Ollie Clements took a set of heavy bails throughout the night but kept getting back up and into his work. A quick Red Bull sales meeting as Asa and Jackson wait for their next run. Big ups to the Queenstown Mountain Bike Club and the Kelly Mcgarry Foundation for always putting on such a dialled event. Volunteers always bring the stoke. Plent of mouths to feed. Laurie Greenland with a steezy one-footer. Vinny Armstrong is very much a crowd favourite. There is always a chainsaw. Big smiles all round. Conor leading out the final McGazza train to end the night. McGazza Forever.",

        "text": "Photo: Riders enjoy the trails at Maple Mountain in North Cowichan, BC, during the MegaVolt eMTB Festival, the first ebike event put on by BC Bike Race. PRESS RELEASE: BC Bike Race For the first time ever, the BC Bike Race has opened registration to e-bikers for the 2025 edition of the race. Remaining true to its roots as an innovator in the mountain bike events space, BCBR will be the first multi-day stage race in North America to launch an e-bike category. This follows on the heels of other international events, such as the Wines2Whales in South Africa and the Volcanic Epic in New Zealand. \u201cThis has been our minds for nearly 10 years since a few German racers asked us why we don\u2019t have a category for eMTB. North America was then and still is about 10 years behind the European adoption of electric bikes. We believe it\u2019s time to start including them in our\u00a0event.\u201d \u2014 Andreas Hestler, Co-founder and Marketing Director for BC Bike\u00a0Race Dubbed the eBCBR, the new category will be open to both SL and full-power eMTBs and will run as a separate and concurrent event. This means the race will NOT mix electric and acoustic on the course at the same time and will create a schedule that gives both rider groups The Ultimate Singletrack Experience. There will also be an untimed option for those who want to ride the course without the pressure of a timing chip. The Journey to This Latest Evolution: BC Bike Race has always evolved alongside the Mountain Bike Industry. At our inception in 2007, the majority of bikes were aluminum hardtails with 26-inch wheels, and there wasn\u2019t a dropper post in sight. Over time, carbon became the norm, full suspension took over, gear ratios grew, and good rubber started to hit the ground. As bikes evolved, the BCBR course has evolved, incorporating more singletrack and more technical terrain. BCBR gives racers the most, and arguably the best, singletrack of any stage race in the world. Now, there are eMountain Bikes. Embracing the history, growth and development of mountain biking, the BC Bike Race is evolving to give more people the chance to enjoy The Ultimate Singletrack Experience.

        "text": "Thank you to Stevie Smith Foundation, Municipality of North Cowichan, All-In Paramedic Services, all the pro riders, Aedan Skinner, Natalie Carrier, Oakley Salvisburg and all our volunteer course marshalls, and shuttle drivers for supporting the event and making it a success. Words by Holly Krasnuik and Darren Burns Photos by Jake Paddon and Natalie Carriere Video by Aedan Skinner What began years ago as a casual campfire chat between Canadian pro DH athletes McKay Vezina and Mark Wallace has now become a reality: Canada\u2019s first-ever Downhill Mountain Bike Combine. The Cowichan Trail Stewardship Society in partnership with Stereo Racing hosted the first annual Downhill Mountain Bike Racing Combine Invitational on Mount Prevost in Duncan BC on November 1-3, 2024. Combines are a traditional method for teams and sports to find and develop new talent; which tests athletic skills such as speed, power, strength (mental and physical) and agility to identify future top players for the sport. The goal was to facilitate an event that would connect industry and unsigned U15-U17 Canadian riders in a meaningful, personal way that would result in a first hand learning experience about racing on the World Cup circuit. Parent participation was an integral portion of the event as we wanted to help facilitate an experience for supporting family members that helped garner awareness about the realistic expectations of what a professional career for their children encompasses. This year\u2019s participants were 13 of BC\u2019s fastest riders between the ages of 14 and 16 who have a goal of one day competing in the World Cup Circuit. These athletes were invited due to their performance at the 2024 BC/Canada Cups. The weekends events included: Friday: Meet and greet. Pro rider led Course inspection. Saturday: closed course practice on a taped course with 12 marshals on Mt.Prevost \u201cRace Trail\u201d Saturday evening: Q&A Panel with 8x industry professionals including UCI Team managers, nutritionist, Sports Physiotherapist, Performance coach and pro athletes. Sunday: Timed training and race run It was great to see how excited the riders and their families were to be there this weekend. It shows the value of what we are trying to do and already has us thinking about next\u00a0year! \u2014 Mark\u00a0Wallace Working with Holly and Mark on the Prevost Combine was a real privilege. As a trail society, being able to provide a platform and a trail for an event like this to take place is extremely rewarding. Our hope is that the Prevost Combine created a stepping stone for these extremely talented and dedicated kids to be able to take their riding careers to the next level. It was a pleasure connecting with the participants, their families, and all the volunteers that contributed time to this unique\u00a0event. \u2014 Lorrie Mansey, CTSS Executive\u00a0Director About the organizers: The Cowichan Trail Stewardship Society was founded and incorporated as a nonprofit organization in 2013 and currently builds, maintains and advocates for excellent mountain biking and hiking trails in the Cowichan Valley; namely on Mt Prevost, Mt Tzouhalem, and Maple Mountain. With more than a decade of industry experience, Stereo Racing is dedicated to coming up with creative solutions to amplify and enhance the meaningful impact and sustainable development of mountain biking both locally and globally.  We are committed to cultivating a pathway for Canadian athletes, nurturing their talent, and fostering a culture that embodies the heart of mountain bike culture in Canada. We strive to empower our team members by instilling values of perseverance, resilience, dedication, and self-respect, to not only excel in racing but also in life.

        "text": "The Local Maydena Bike Park, Australia Photography: Ryan Finlay // @rfphotographics Welcome to the jungle Australia might be known for it's red dirt, endless coastlines and putting shrimps on the barbie , but don't be fooled, you'll also find some world class riding. Tasmania aka Tassie, is Australia\u2019s only island state and this rugged little island is filled with lush, dense forest and its reputation as a mountain biking hotspot has exploded over recent years, luring riders from all over the world. Maydena Bike Park is a gravity park with over 800m of elevation (most of any bike park in Australia) that officially opened in January 2018. It's located in Tasmania\u2019s scenic Derwent Valley - an easy 1 hour and a 15-minute drive from Hobart CBD, or a 1 hour and 30-minute drive from Hobart airport. Jackson Goldstone giving The Local his signature 'tap' of approval. The Local is just one of close to 100 individual trails at Maydena Bike Park. It combines dense temperate rainforest vibes with epic, perfectly groomed jumps, rollers, and berms. Located on the lower slopes of the bike park, The Local can be accessed via a wide variety of technical, flow, or jump trails. There are two different uplift services, a fast turn around Lower Mountain ATV shuttle, and the Full Mountain shuttle bus service, taking in every metre of the parks immense 820m vertical elevation range... (be right back, going to look at flights). The park is closed during the [Southern Hemisphere's] Winter months and usually opens near the end of September. Long-travel trail bikes or DH rigs are recommended - there is a bike rental shop at the base if you don't want to travel with your own rig, along with a cafe & beer garden so you can have a break, grab a coffee, or chat over a beer and good food after a day of riding. Despite being the home of Red Bull Hardline in Australia, and having hosted multiple world-level gravity events, Maydena Bike Park also has one of Australia\u2019s biggest networks of beginner-friendly flow trails - check out some of their recommendations . The Dirt Art team worked their magic to design and craft this place into a MTB Mecca and are well-known for their sustainable trail design methodologies, and construction. It\u2019s not just flow and jump trails here, half the trails at Maydena are natural, hand built tech trails and each one is unique, making the options endless with each lap. The Local is a jump trail with pretty much everything including hips both ways, nice and wide and when dry it would run prime and even let you slow down a bit so you can get more pop. - Mitch\u00a0(hardinggrim) It's safe to say that Tassie is that like that quiet friend who lets everyone else brag, but deep down, it\u2019s holding some of the best trails, the kind you\u2019ll never stop thinking about.",

        "author": "Dario DiGiulio",

        "text": "Mountain bike apparel takes itself a bit too seriously at times, with graphics and technical details that can have you looking like you're lining up for a Supercross race while you're casually pedaling to the top of a hill. That look might not be for everyone, and as a result we're seeing more brands offer lower-key alternatives for riding kit. Curious Creatures fits that bill well, with simple designs for women and men focused on comfort and utility. All the fabrics mentioned here are Bluesign approved, and Curious Creatures offers a repair service through a Montana-based sewing studio for any damage that may occur through use. Sun Dog Shorts Details \u2022 Knit waistband w/ drawstring \u2022 12.5\" inseam \u2022 2 zip pockets, 1 snap pocket \u2022 100% polyester body, spandex waist \u2022 2 colors \u2022 Sizes: Men's 28-40 \u2022 Price: $180 USD \u2022 wearecuriouscreatures.com The Sun Dog shorts are very lightweight, with a stretchy and breathable fabric body that feels ideal for hotter temps. Their knit waistband is one of the more unique elements, with no closure to speak of aside from the internal drawstring to tighten things up. The women's version, known as the Bitterroot , employs a similar design, but with a taller waistband cuff and a different pocket layout. Those are available in 2 colors, and standard sizes from 0 to 20. Sun Dog Pants Details \u2022 Knit waistband w/ drawstring \u2022 31\" inseam \u2022 2 zip pockets, 1 snap pocket \u2022 100% polyester body, spandex waist \u2022 3 colors \u2022 Overlapping ankle cuff with snap adjustment \u2022 Sizes: Men's 28-40 \u2022 Price: $180 USD \u2022 wearecuriouscreatures.com Much like the shorts version, the Sun Dog Pants are lightweight and breathable, but the 31\" inseam goes most of the way to a shoe, depending on how lanky you are. They employ a unique adjustment at the ankle, with two snaps to allow for a tighter or looser fit per your preference. The overall fit plays well with kneepads, thanks to a cut that isn't skin tight per size. The women's Sun Dog Pant comes with a taller waistband, a 29.5\" inseam, and is offered in 5 colors. Sizes range from 0 to 18, with the same dual snap lower cuff adjustment. Ramble Scramble Shorts Details \u2022 Shank button w/ internal drawstring \u2022 7\" or 11.5\" inseam \u2022 7 pockets, 1 with zipper \u2022 100% polyester w/ stretch \u2022 3 colors \u2022 Sizes: Men's 28-40 \u2022 Price: $139 USD \u2022 wearecuriouscreatures.com The Ramble Scramble shorts are more standard issue than the Sun Dog, with a heavier weight fabric, standard closure, and two inseam options. They feature two hand pockets, two back pockets, two thigh pockets (one with a zipper), and the little coin pocket you never know what to do with. The Women's version features the 7\" inseam only, but does come in 6 different colors, and sizes from 0 to 20. The pocket layout is the same, as is the fabric weight. Ride Impressions I've been riding and lounging in these three items for a few months now, with conditions spanning the gamut from summer highs to winter's deepest depths. I have a size 32 in all three items, and though I typically wear a 31/32, I'd probably opt for a 33 for the Curious Creatures fit. The waist is a little tighter than other 32s I have, but more importantly the front of the pants & shorts fit more like a women's cut, with less room for the male anatomy. On the bike this isn't an issue, but they can feel a little snug if you're trying to bridge the shorts into a more casual setting. Performance-wise, I'm really impressed with the fabric Curious Creatures has developed. For riding in hot weather, the Bird Dog pants and shorts feel perfectly suited, venting heat and moisture without issue. The knit waistband is a novel and well-designed feature as well, staying comfortable over very long days in the saddle, and never developing any pinch points or rubbing. The Ramble Scramble shorts have a massive amount of stretch to them, defying expectation for what otherwise looks like a standard 5-pocket short. The longer of the two inseam options will probably be the choice for those looking to wear them with kneepads, as the 7\" inseam provides quite the gaper gap. That said, the 7\" sans pads is a pretty ideal summer move, if you're willing to let the thighs shine and risk the skinned knee. Though I can't personally attest for the fit or function, the Curious Creatures women's lineup looks like one of the more well-considered on the market. The fit and function are designed for women first, as opposed to a reworking of the men's lineup. There are some additional items to the women's catalog that don't feature on the men's side, so head over to the Curious Creatures website to dig in. I'm working on a long-winded apparel mega review, with deeper comparison between a variety of items, so stay tuned for that to see how the Curious Creatures kit stacks up against the field.",

        "text": "After all the commotion with the previous brand, Nige decided to get the band back together (at least some of them) on their new rigs and test out the new Abus Airdrop lids up around the Golfie and over at Glentress. With Elliott now on the Foes, Ant Hale on the Static, and Nigel and young local ripper Fransady Keita on the Evil rigs. The trail fairies have been hard at work on Flat White, it is incredible now so thank you very much for the graft. It doesn't seem like a bit of time off has slowed Elliott down either, riding just as good as I've ever seen him ride - albeit a bit more playful on that Foes with it being a little smaller than previous bikes. And yes, he is going on I'm a Celeb next year, or so I heard anyway. This was also the first ride for Ant Hale on his new Static eBike and it's great to see another UK brand giving it a go. Alongside those two, Nige brought out Fransady, a very stylish young rider with big potential on the Evil.. I haven't seen a table clicked like his in a good while. Big up 50to01 for sorting all the lads out with some top tier riding gear. Hope you enjoy some classic Golfie ripping. Cheers to Abus for supporting the project.",

        "author": "louiMtb",
        "date": "03-05-2025",
        "text": "Words: Cable Bay Enduro The Cable Bay Enduro and New Zealand Enduro MTB National Championships took place over the weekend at the Cable Bay Adventure Park in Nelson, offering riders three exhilarating days of practice and racing under perfect weather conditions. The event, now in its sixth edition, featured eight challenging stages spread across two days, with a half-day of practice and racing on Saturday, followed by a full day of competition on Sunday. Saturday's action commenced with shuttled practice sessions on the initial stages, allowing riders to familiarise themselves with the terrain before tackling the first three timed stages later in the day. The atmosphere was electric, with participants ranging from first-time racers to seasoned professionals, all eager to make their mark on the national championship course. For racing, riders were given a short shuttle before pedalling through some of Cable Bay Adventure Park's most lush terrain. Stage one for this year was The Poacher, a new trail which opened for last year\u2019s event. The trail includes a big rock roll, which this year claimed a few riders who were pushing hard to beat the clock. Stage 2 was a short but punchy stage, which had been left with minimal catches after practice. It was a fine line between getting through unscathed and pushing too hard and blowing corners out, with some finding the limit. To finish day 1 of racing riders descended Veto and were met by over 300+ spectators, many of whom were dressed up with the hope of winning the Soundboks Go speaker that was up for grabs. Sunday's full day of racing encompassed five additional stages, each presenting its own set of technical challenges and demanding terrains. Riders navigated a cumulative elevation gain of approximately 1600 meters over 30 kilometres and over 2000 metres of descents. The well-maintained trails of Cable Bay Adventure Park, combined with the favourable weather, provided ideal racing conditions. However, as the day went on, the heat began to take its toll. The opening stage for Day 2 was a brand new trail which opened for the event. The trail, named The Courthouse, certainly served up some challenges as riders descended deep into the valley floor. The Courthouse was not only the longest descent of the weekend, but it included the steepest sections as well. Following stage 4, riders were on their own with no more shuttle assistance. Stage 5 was a park favourite CCR into Lost Time, followed by Stage 6, Broken Gnome, Stage 7, Missing Link into Jurassic, before tackling the final Stage 8, PineIine. Crossing the finish line, riders were handed a cold refreshment thanks to the team at Two Thumb Brewery before watching the remainder of the field tackle the stage. As times were confirmed, riders enjoyed more refreshments and a buffet meal to conclude an epic weekend of riding. With the sun still shining, the awards ceremony was one to remember as riders, sponsors and volunteers were celebrated for all their efforts. The winners of the Under 19 and Elite divisions were as follows: Elite Men: 1st Place: Brady Stone (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Joe Millington 3rd Place: Lachie Ross Elite Women: 1st Place: Xanthe Robb (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Winni Goldsbury 3rd Place: Zoe Trolove Under 19 Men: 1st Place: Eli Robertson (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Nico Schroder 3rd Place: Seppy Binsbergen Under 19 Women: 1st Place: Lucy Kemp (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Iley Nunns Full results here The Cable Bay Enduro continues to solidify its reputation as a premier event on New Zealand's mountain biking calendar, offering riders of all levels an opportunity to compete in a professionally organized and challenging environment. The success of this year's championships underscores the dedication of the organizers, volunteers, and sponsors in promoting the growth and recognition of Enduro mountain biking in New Zealand. For 2026, The Cable Bay Enduro will once more take place at Cable Bay Adventure Park and will certainly be an event not to miss as the organizers have some exciting plans taking shape. The reins for the National Championships, however, will be passed on to whom we have yet to find out! Photo credit thanks to Digby Shaw & Rory Stock",

        "text": "Crankworx Rotorua 2025 wrapped up with high-speed head-to-head action at the Specialized Dual Slalom, as athletes tackled a brand-new, repurposed Speed & Style course at Skyline Rotorua. The challenging terrain and uncertain bike choice made for an intense day of racing, pushing riders to their limits. Caroline Buchanan Takes Gold Over Jordy Scott In the women\u2019s final, former Queen of Crankworx, Caroline Buchanan faced Jordy Scott in a dramatic battle. Scott held a 0.237-second advantage going into the second run, but Buchanan\u2019s acceleration in the final flat section proved too strong, allowing her to clinch victory. Adding to her remarkable win, Buchanan was forced to race on an unfamiliar bike after her Dual Slalom bike was stolen just a week before arriving in Rotorua. \u201cThis course was so technical. Shark fin features that really threw a different element to the racing today\u201d, Caroline Buchanan about the new course. The small final saw Pump Track Champion Sabina Ko\u0161\u00e1rkov\u00e1 grab her second bronze medal of the festival, after also finishing third in the Pump Track Challenge earlier this week. In her first-ever Crankworx Dual Slalom, Ko\u0161\u00e1rkov\u00e1 defeated young Canadian Slopestyle standout Natasha Miller, who slipped on the final left-hand berm, sealing Ko\u0161\u00e1rkov\u00e1\u2019s podium spot. Women\u2019s Top 5: 1. Caroline Buchanan (AUS) 2. Jordy Scott (USA) 3. Sabina Ko\u0161\u00e1rkov\u00e1 (CZE) 4. Natasha Miller (CAN) 5. Laura Smulders (NED) Ryan Gilchrist Defends 2024 Victory In a nail-biting gold medal battle against Sam Blenkinsop, Ryan Gilchrist emerged victorious despite a tricky first run where he nearly missed the final gates. Gilchrist came back strong, laying down the fastest time of the day at 19.961 seconds - a significant gap over the second-fastest run by Tuhoto-Ariki Pene (20.305s). With this, he secured back-to-back victories in Rotorua, defending his 2024 Specialized Dual Slalom gold and once again displayed his prowess and pedal power. Kiwi rider Sam Blenkinsop showcased that after several years of racing within the Crankworx circuit, he is still a force to be reckoned with and not to be counted out of the battle for the 2025 crown. In the bronze medal match, Gilchrist\u2019s YETI teammate Richie Rude faced off against local hero and 2023 King of Crankworx, Tuhoto-Ariki Pene. Pene, in a dramatic turn, missed the final gates and was disqualified, awarding Rude with a bronze medal in his first-ever Crankworx Dual Slalom. Men\u2019s Podium: 1. Ryan Gilchrist (AUS) 2.

        "text": "We are proud to present \"Blue Ribbon\", a public trail located on Galbraith Mountain in Bellingham, WA. This project is the culmination of years of permitting work, hours of machine time, and finished off by selfless volunteer work. Watch the video above to learn about how it came to be, and come visit us in Bellingham to catch a lap down this mind bending trail! Step 1: All trails require one thing, a corridor. To establish ours for this project we worked with local trail advocacy group, the WMBC, to obtain permits and find a window of time for construction. All said and done, this took nearly four years from when we kicked off the project proposal to when we broke ground. During that time we walked the proposed zone, looking for the right grade to create the flow we were after. With the planning and layout completed, the trail building mastermind, Nico Vink, arrived to start breaking ground. Step 2: Realize it's too much work for one person and call your friends. We quickly realized it would be too much work for Nico so we called in TR GiddyUp ambassadors Teddy Jaramillo and Henry Lanman. They run a trail building operation in New Mexico, and were the perfect people to get on the job. Nico had always wanted to work with a crew of three and this project lined up perfect for that. Henry ran the big excavator clearing corridor and mining dirt while Teddy followed creating general shapes for Nico to finish and fine tune in his machine. Step 3: Dig 'till you can't dig anymore, then dig a little more. Nico, Henry and Ted were able to work for a solid month of spring, 2023, before the dirt became too dry to continue shaping. Nico then returned to Belgium to ride his bike and process the work he had already completed on Blue Ribbon. Giving him a summer to visualize the flow he had in mind for the trail. With some refreshed energy, he returned to Bellingham that Fall to complete the machine work on the trail. Countless days ensued with the help of WMBC's Ryan Joslyn to create the final shapes that you can ride on Blue Ribbon today. Step 4: Find every available shovel and pair of hands to butter up the trail after the winter. With all the machine work in the past, it was time for us and the community to get our hands dirty and butter up the remaining bits of the trail. Nico had done almost 95% of the work with the machine, but a few transitions still needed some shaping. With the help of the community and a company dig day the trail took its final transformations and was ready to ride. Step 5: Open the trail to the world, and get some laps! After battling with some wacky Spring weather, we finally opened Blue Ribbon in June of 2024. Thanks to everyone who helped along the way and came out for the opening celebration. And a huge shout to Nico Vink for his relentless work and contributing to making this community better and better. This trail was a huge effort, and we are stoked to give it to the community. Hope to see you out there soon! You can find the trail HERE . Grab your friends and check it out this Fall!",

        "text": "Haf Land and Fleur TK's North Wales Adventure Video by Samantha Saskia Dugon Photos by Sophie Skelton I'm H\u00e2f Land, and I ride for Starling Cycles. I joined the family just over a year ago as a racer, and for 2025 I'm mixing this up a bit. Rather than competing, I'm going to focus on some adventures - big rides, fun stuff, and making some content. I'm excited! To get started, Fleur and I caught up for a local adventure in North Wales. She's a fellow Starling rider and one you've probably seen here in this video . We met up with filmmaker Samantha Saskia Dugon and also Sophie Skelton, who was capturing the day in pictures. The plan was to head out for the day and explore some of my local trails around Llanberis, in North Wales. I moved back here from Scotland a little while ago and have been really loving getting to know the place again, and wanted to show Fleur round. It was the perfect opportunity to shoot a video. We met bright and early (10 am!) and everyone was just super friendly. We all just got on great from the word go, which was a great start. We started off at a caf\u00e9 to grab some coffee from a lovely yellow shop on the high street that matched Fleur\u2019s bike! No coffee for me though - I\u2019m Gen Z, so I don\u2019t need it, according to Fleur, who is a Millennial and drinks a flat white. We set off up the hill with big smiles on our faces and butterflies in my tummy because I didn\u2019t want anything to go wrong! We had an amazing time shooting this little project, and it was so great to have an all-female creative team\u2014so much stoke! Sam was incredible and so well-organised with her filming, making the day stress-free and fun for all of us. Sophie recently moved up to Mid Wales and came along to take photos as she is developing different skills and techniques to use in her photography. Seeing her and Sam bouncing ideas off one another was so cool. Fleur is always absolutely awesome and drove all the way from Scotland that same morning just to see me! We filmed the day over four separate tracks and did a lot of pushing up through brash, which was less fun. But we ended up with some awesome footage and newfound inspiration for riding again. 2024 was a funny one for me, I started out racing really well, but had a bad-luck accident where I dropped a bike on my head and struggled with a concussion for months. I found it hard to be excited or inspired about riding for so long - but this adventure really brought back my love for riding. I had the best day and felt so at ease in the company of these three amazing women. As I\u2019m sure we will see in the video, Fleur and I had a few tumbles! It was mostly on the same section of track, straight into the bushes! By some power of the universe, despite the high ratio of crashing to not crashing, Fleur, myself, and our bikes came out unscathed, bar a few scratches and a lot of laughter! No broken brake levers, PHEW! The trails in the area, although not many in number, rate very highly in my books. With some amazing craftsmanship on display, it\u2019s clear that a lot of time and effort has gone into these tracks, and we were so grateful to be given permission to film there. The scenery was incredible, and we got so incredibly lucky with the weather\u2014it was dreamy! After a long day of filming and dilly-dallying, we were so ready for another caf\u00e9 break before calling it a day. We headed to an amazing local spot at the end of the lake, which I had been hyping up all day. We were all so ready for some nice hot food and drove there, only to find out it was closed. DEVASTATING. By this point, we were hanging. We were out of snacks, and just about keeping our eyes open. We called it quits and headed back to the caf\u00e9 we had visited in the morning. We had something to drink and some cake (as all the hot food had sold out), then made our way back to the car park. After a long day of grafting, with three out of four of us having long drives back to various parts of the UK, we called it a day and headed home. And what a day it was! I\u2019m super grateful to have been given this opportunity. I hope you all enjoy watching it! Expect to see more of this soon! CREDITS: This project was produced by an all-female crew.

The energy in the crowd was electric, especially as Kiwi athletes took to the track in this chainless head-to-head showdown. No stranger to the Crankworx World Tour Jackson Frew won his first ever Pump Track gold medal, while his female counterpart Laura Smulders is a brand-new face to the Crankworx family. As Round 2 of the 2025 Crankworx Pump Track Series, the stakes were high, with riders pushing their limits on the technical and fast course. In the women\u2019s final, Dutch racers Manon Veenstra and Laura Smulders battled to the wire. Smulders edged out her fellow Dutchie Veenstra in a nail-biting finish, winning gold by just 0.007 seconds. The small final saw New Zealand\u2019s Sacha Earnest go head-to-head against reigning Pump Track World Champion and winner of the Crankworx Summer Series Christchurch Pump Track event, Sabina Ko\u0161\u00e1rkov\u00e1 of the Czech Republic.

Despite clocking the fastest run of the event earlier in the night, Pene finished 0.067 seconds behind Frew in the finals, settling for silver. The bronze medal match featured Kiwi speedster Tyler Waite and Aussie Bailey Meares, who was returning to competition after an extended injury break last year. Meares managed to edge out Waite by +0.106 seconds in a nail-biting second run. A significant upset came in the quarterfinals when Australian rider Ryan Gilchrist, the defending King of Crankworx and winner of Round 1 of the 2025 Pump Track Series, crashed out, allowing his teammate Tyler Waite to advance.

        "text": "Full event replay Words: Crankworx The Maxxis Slopestyle in Memory of McGazza, the opening event of the Crankworx FMBA Slopestyle World Championship (SWC), delivered an electrifying showcase of progression and high-stakes competition under clear and calm skies. Originally scheduled for Sunday, the event was moved to this morning due to strong winds in the forecast. After extensive consultations and careful consideration of multiple scenarios, athletes unanimously opted for an electrifying new competition format: a high-stakes two-run elimination battle. This strategic shift not only raised the intensity but also gave all riders the opportunity to perform on the big stage of the SWC. For the men, the field was cut in half after Run 1, while the women\u2019s competition saw the top five of eight riders advancing to a second round. Women\u2019s Competition: A New Era Continues Now in only its second season within the Crankworx FMBA Slopestyle World Championship, the women\u2019s competition reinforced that these athletes are pushing the limits and proving they belong on the world\u2019s biggest stage. Germany\u2019s Patricia Druwen made a powerful comeback from illness, throwing down an incredible 87.75-point run filled with technical mastery and precision. Her trick list included an X-Up to Suicide No Hander, a Double Oppo Bar Spin, and a Backflip Tuck No Hander, solidifying her place as a serious title contender this season. Joining Druwen in the final five were Natasha Miller, Robin Goomes, Shealen Reno, and Zoe Witwicki. Meanwhile, Renata Wiese and Natalia Niedzwiedz, competing in their first-ever SWC event, struggled with speed on the course and were eliminated after Run 1. The final runs saw Zoe Witwicki better her score but fall short of catching 2023 SWC Champion Shealen Reno, finishing fourth after missing speed into the whale tail. Meanwhile, Druwen, Miller, and Goomes celebrated their podium positions with a stylish party train down the course. Women\u2019s Results: 1. Patricia Druwen (GER) \u2013 87.75 pts 2. Natasha Miller (CAN) \u2013 80.50 pts 3. Robin Goomes (NZL) \u2013 75.25 pts 4. Shealen Reno (USA) \u2013 67.50 pts 5. Zoe Witwicki (CAN) \u2013 61.25 pts 6. Renata Wiese (CHI) \u2013 35 pts 7 Natalia Niedzwiedz (POL) \u2013 19 pts Men\u2019s Competition: Tim Bringer Finally Takes Gold After eight podium finishes in the SWC, France\u2019s Tim Bringer finally claimed his first-ever Crankworx FMBA Slopestyle World Championship victory, dominating the field with a 93.25-point run that left his competitors in the dust. Dropping in last, his 360 Double Tailwhip to Bar Spin, Double Backflip Tuck No Hander, and 360 Tuck No Hander In-Double Backflip Out solidified his spot at the top \u2013 an untouchable lead that no one could surpass in Run 2. The 2024 Red Bull Rookie of the Year, Kaidan Ingersoll (USA), proved his rising star status, bettering his score in Run 2 to secure silver with 90.87 points. Meanwhile, Canadian Ben Thompson, a last-minute entry after injuries in the field, made an immediate impact, earning bronze with an 82.92-point first run. The final round saw Paul Couderc, Griffin Paulson, Jake Atkinson, and Max Fredriksson advance, though Paulson, Atkinson, and Fredriksson all crashed on the final feature, much to the crowd\u2019s amazement. Men\u2019s Top 8 Results: 1. Tim Bringer (FRA) \u2013 93.25 pts 2. Kaidan Ingersoll (USA) \u2013 90.87 pts 3. Ben Thompson (CAN) \u2013 82.92 pts 4. Paul Couderc (FRA) \u2013 82.06 pts 5. Chance Moore (CAN) \u2013 81.25 pts 6. Griffin Paulson (CAN) \u2013 80.42 pts 7. Jake Atkinson (GBR) \u2013 79.25 pts 8. Max Fredriksson (SWE) \u2013 78.92 pts Full results here . What\u2019s Next? The 2025 Maxxis Slopestyle in Memory of McGazza set the tone for an explosive season ahead, proving that both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s competitions are more competitive than ever. With the RockShox K\u0101rearea Downhill already underway on a brand-new course at Skyline Rotorua, the action is far from over. Tune in for live coverage on Red Bull TV at 3:15 PM NZDT. And with the Specialized Dual Slalom wrapping up the Crankworx Rotorua festival tomorrow, fans can expect even more high-speed action before the tour moves on to the next stop. >>Full Results >>Schedule >>Broadcast Replay",

        "text": "Words: Crankworx On an action-packed day, the second round of the Crankworx Downhill Series took place this afternoon at Skyline Rotorua, marking the return of Elite Downhill racing to this renowned venue. After two years at Whakarewarewa Forest, the RockShox K\u0101rearea Downhill challenged riders with a brand-new course, delivering steep descents, tight corners, and loose, unpredictable conditions. Kiwi talents Jenna Hastings and Lachie Stevens-McNab proved their dominance once again, repeating their gold medal performances from the Redemption Downhill in Christchurch earlier this season. Jenna Hastings, coming in as the top-seeded rider, laid down a flawless and aggressive run, securing gold with a commanding 6.259-second lead over Switzerland\u2019s Camille Balanche. Despite a challenging lower section that forced her onto the slower B-line, Louise Ferguson claimed third place, rounding out the women\u2019s podium. Women\u2019s Top 5 Results: 1. Jenna Hastings (NZL) - 3:17.651 2. Camille Balanche (SUI) - 3:23.910 3. Louise Ferguson (GBR) - 3:26.00 4. Lisa Bouladou (FRA) - 3:28.688 5. Jess Blewitt (NZL) - 3:30.018 In the men\u2019s race, local Rotorua rider Lachie Stevens-McNab thrilled the home crowd with a lightning-fast run to claim victory by a full 0.603-second margin over fellow Kiwi and former King of Crankworx, Tuhoto-Ariki Pene. The battle for third was fierce, with Matt Walker finishing just over three seconds behind Pene, followed closely by Yeti teammates Richie Rude and Ryan Gilchrist. Men\u2019s Top 5 Results: 1. Lachie Stevens-McNab (NZL) - 2:50.949 2. Tuhoto-Ariki Pene (NZL) - 2:51.552 3. Matt Walker (GBR) - 2:54.330 4. Richie Rude (USA) - 2:54.884 5. Ryan Gilchrist (AUS) - 2:56.746 Full results can be found here . Other highlights included Kiwi riders Charlie Makea, Sam Blenkinsop, and Joe Millington, who threw down loose and aggressive runs to finish in 6th, 7th, and 8th place, showcasing their technical prowess on the new course. Meanwhile, U19 sensation Tyler Waite stunned fans once again with a top time of 2:54.211, which would have placed him third in the Elite Men\u2019s category - solidifying his reputation as one to watch for the future. Rotorua Roulette and What\u2019s Next To cap off the day, fans were treated to another new format on the schedule, the Rotorua Roulette, a best trick contest at the final feature of the Maxxis Slopestyle course with crowd participation. With the RockShox K\u0101rearea Downhill in the books, Crankworx Rotorua 2025 rolls on into its final day tomorrow with the Specialized Dual Slalom, set to take place on a repurposed Speed & Style course, featuring creative elements like two pond gaps and a hitching post.

        "title": "The Man Behind the Berms: Kyle Strait on Crafting Sea Otter\u2019s Dual Slalom",
        "author": "lifetimeseaotterclassic",
        "date": "03-07-2025",
        "text": "Words: Dan Hughes I get bored easily\u2026as a human and as a\u00a0rider. \u2014 Kyle\u00a0Strait This sentiment, expressed by the man behind the dual slalom courses at the Life Time Sea Otter Classic presented by Continental, Kyle Strait, goes a long way to explaining the continued excitement and staying power of the discipline at Laguna Seca. From young racer to master builder, Strait\u2019s cycling career has taken him around the globe, but always with a soft spot for Sea Otter. Originally from Southern California, Strait first encountered Sea Otter through the pages of mountain bike magazines. Inspired by what he saw, he asked his father if they could attend and, in 2000, got his first taste of the scale of a Sea Otter. You come up the hill to the guard shack and can see the whole place, the XC folks, the pits, and the hill where the dual slalom is\u2026it\u2019s\u00a0huge. \u2014 Kyle\u00a0Strait But the size of Sea Otter didn\u2019t seem to deter Strait, and it didn\u2019t take long for him to make his mark, winning the (adult) Pro Dirt Jumping competition at the age of 13. From there, Strait would become a fixture not only at Sea Otter but in the world of slopestyle riding, missing only two Sea Otters since 1999 (one when Sea Otter\u2019s date was moved to the fall, and one when he was rehabbing a broken knee cap) and being the only rider invited to every edition of the Red Bull Rampage (and its first two-time champion). This connection to the sport is what helped Strait add course-building to his resume as a rider. After years of building tracks for himself and others, Strait got the call from Sea Otter to design the dual slalom courses in 2022. I had built lots of tracks as an amateur, but when I had the opportunity to carry on the legacy of Keith Defiebre (longtime Sea Otter dual slalom course designer) and work on the tracks at Laguna Seca, I, of course, said\u00a0\u2018yes.\u2019 \u2014 Kyle\u00a0Strait But the work on the hillside wasn\u2019t straightforward, both in terms of soil and the task at hand: You\u2019ve got four different kinds of dirt to deal with there, and the weather. It\u2019s also one of the only sports you can do where professionals at a high level and amateurs use the same course. You\u2019ve got to design a course that\u2019s challenging and safe for every\u00a0rider. \u2014 Kyle\u00a0Strait Strait\u2019s process for course building is a time-intensive process. Starting 21 days out, he and his team build features from scratch with an eye towards accommodating riders of every stripe and incorporating features from favourite tracks around the world. For a pro, I might build three rollers that they can triple, but an amateur can roll, and I also want to take care of the adaptive racers, making sure the track is at least 39\u201d wide. Sometimes, I think \u2018that section from CrankWorx was awesome, let\u2019s do\u00a0that. \u2014 Kyle\u00a0Strait And then comes the testing, which Strait does himself, although he has to employ a few tricks to approximate the feel for each rider group. I try to give myself as many handicaps as possible when I do the testing to get a sense of what it\u2019ll feel like for a first-time rider. I\u2019ll do the whole course seated, or with no brakes, or with my hands reversed to make sure it\u2019s rideable for\u00a0everyone. \u2014 Kyle\u00a0Strait On race day, upwards of 600 athletes put the course through its paces with multiple practice runs, qualifiers, and the finals. Winners are crowned, and Strait takes photos to document the courses before they\u2019re wiped away for another year. It\u2019s a county park, so we return it to its natural state. That means we have to start from scratch at every Sea Otter, which is a challenge, but we craft unique courses every year and get different winners as well. If the 2024 course wasn\u2019t what you like in dual slalom, then you\u2019ll probably love the 2025\u00a0course. \u2014 Kyle\u00a0Strait In the end, Strait\u2019s stewardship of the dual slalom event is about more than just one rider\u2019s love of the sport; it\u2019s a confirmation of the sport\u2019s place in a score of riders\u2019 histories. I remember sitting in the back of my dad\u2019s truck, trying to warm up from the freezing rain, competing against riders years older than me in the 18-and-under category [in 2000]. Sea Otter has kept three generations of dual slalom riders going. I\u2019m proud to be part of\u00a0that. \u2014 Kyle\u00a0Strait",

        "text": "PRESS RELEASE: BikePark Wales We are stoked to announce the opening of the highly anticipated bottom half of Boomslang, an extension of our natural tech black downhill trail that promises excitement for any rider who loves a mix of terrain, big features and the challenge of multiple line choice! You'll be double-dipping this track for sure! Boomslang is unlike any other trail in the park. With its raw, natural terrain, you can expect a track that evolves with every run. The ever-changing nature of the trail means no two runs will ever feel the same. From drops, jumps and root gaps to high-speed sections and creative line options, Boomslang is a challenge for all riders. If you remember how the top section of this trail evolved, this lower half will follow a similar journey. What starts off as deep loam will turn to a raw mudder through this winter. Then, as people ride it, new lines will open up and get rutted in, and more rock will appear. Prepare for a different feel every time you ride it. Boomslang can be found by traversing across towards the start of Pandoras Rocks, Fifty Shades and Terry\u2019s Belly. The new start hill for Boomslang, giving you better speed for the flowier top section, is on the left as you pedal across. It heads down the steepest part of our hillside through thick woods, open off-camber sections with built-up gaps and big box features. Trail Highlights Type: Natural Tech Black Downhill Features: Drops, off-camber loam, berms, ruts, doubles, and flat-out speed sections Unique Appeal: Constantly evolving trail, raw and technical, offering a fresh challenge every ride. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited to launch the new bottom half of Boomslang. This trail is a game-changer\u2014not just for us but for riders who crave the thrill of natural, technical terrain. It's everything you love about your local track, but now with the incredible setting, infrastructure, and energy of BikePark Wales.\u201d The new bottom half of Boomslang officially opens on Thursday, 30th January. Get ready for your new favourite line at BikePark Wales! See you on the trails The BPW Team",

        "title": "Interview: Cam McCaul Talks Natural Selection Bike Event",
        "author": "Stephane Pelletier",
        "date": "03-04-2025",
        "text": "INTERVIEW Cam McCaul On Natural Selection Bike Words by Stephane Pelletier / Photos: Izzy Lidsky, Tyler Roemer Cam McCaul is a true legend of the sport. A rider who inspired thousands with his riding and energy, he continues to shape the sport as a pro rider, commentator, and all-around personality. Most recently, Cam's been deep in the development of Natural Selection Bike, Todd Barber's brainchild, and a real evolution from the Proving Grounds and Rampage formats we're used to. I got the chance to sit down with Cam and chat about Natural Selection, how it all came together, where it's headed, and what everyone can look forward to in tomorrow's broadcast. The live broadcast of NST Bike kicks off March 5th at 12 PM PST. In the meantime, enjoy Cam! Cam McCaul, Proving Grounds, Pacific City, Oregon. Natural Selection has been a groundbreaking event in snowboarding\u2014how did the idea of bringing it to mountain biking first come about Cam McCaul: Todd Barber started \u201cProving Grounds,\u201d which had the original mission of creating an event that could fill the gap between slopestyle and Rampage. In a nutshell, Proving Grounds caught the attention of Natural Selection as they were exploring the idea of expanding into other sports. If you think about it, there\u2019s a common motivation there. NST was started by Travis Rice, looking to fill a gap in competitive snowboarding. Todd was doing a similar thing with mountain biking, and those paths converged. To be honest, I think NST is a great direction forward for all four sports that are involved (snowboarding, ski, surf, MTB), and I\u2019m just so excited that mountain biking gets to be a part of it. What was your role in helping make this event a reality? Cam McCaul: If you really believe in something and you want to see it come to life, you\u2019re just down to get in wherever you fit in. I initially fit in as someone Todd could brainstorm his ideas with during the Proving Grounds days. That evolved into wandering around the woods with Todd, Carson Storch, and Kyle Jameson trying to envision course designs for the original Proving Grounds in Prineville, Oregon, then I was creating content to promote that event, then I was test-riding some features, then I was the \u201cAthlete Liaison\u201d to kind of be the conduit between the athletes and the event crew, then I was the announcer for the event, then the host of the broadcast once it got to that stage, etc. Now that Proving Grounds has evolved into Natural Selection Bike, I\u2019m working with the NST team in a lot of different ways to ensure we\u2019re staying true to our sport, creating something that fills a void, helping with athlete selections, running the @naturalselectionbike Instagram account under the guidance of our NST social whizzes, announcing the event on-site, and I\u2019ll be in the studio for the broadcast coming up March 5. How did you and the rest of the team go about choosing New Zealand as the location for the first-ever Natural Selection MTB event? Cam McCaul: New Zealand is not only full of great terrain and natural beauty but Queenstown, in particular, is also kind of THE SPOT for mountain biking during our northern hemisphere winters. I wasn\u2019t on the scout trip when they chose the location, but if you watch the documentary \u201cSearch for Natural Selection Bike,\u201d you can see how many different potential venues they explored before finally finding the right one. They seriously left no stone unturned in the search. It\u2019s insane how dialled the venue at Mt. Dewar is for this event, first and foremost for the terrain, the pitch, the quality of dirt, etc., but also because Queenstown feels like the MTB epicentre this time of year. Everywhere you look, there are iconic zones, and the majority of the best riders in the world are passing through all season. Plus, the locals are some of the best people ever in addition to being some of the best riders/builders in the world. Cam McCaul, Proving Grounds, Pacific City, Oregon. What were the biggest challenges in adapting the Natural Selection concept to mountain biking? Cam McCaul: Well, the best part is, that\u2019s not really the objective\u2026 It\u2019s not a mission to create a snowboarding contest on mountain bikes. The mission is to create something new, unique and true to OUR SPORT. Each sport NST gets involved with has the creative freedom to structure its events to fill a needed gap in that individual sport. Coincidentally (or not), what this ends up creating is something that runs parallel with the riding that the athletes do on their own time and in their video parts. What kind of riding style and athlete mindset does this format reward compared to traditional freeride or slopestyle events? Cam McCaul: I\u2019d say it really rewards riders who spend less time on the airbags and more time on the trails. Yes, you need tricks to do well, but maintaining flow and remembering speeds in order to link together a great top-to-bottom run really ended up being the most valuable skill a rider could bring to this event. I had this realization halfway through the week while watching practice \u2013 The riders who end up on the podium will be the ones who nail the best one-take segment in their contest run. How much usable footage for a segment can you produce in your comp run\u2026? You gotta rip the trail sections, roost the berms, pop the hips, trick the drops, trick the jumps. The riders who drop runs that could be a film segment\u2026those are the riders who will score high and place well. Sensai for the new generation. The terrain looked absolutely insane\u2014what were some of the key elements that made this course unique? Cam McCaul: The top and middle of the venue are where the natural terrain features are on display. Making those natural features rideable and linking them together with singletrack and bike-park flow sections was a task that the build team executed beautifully. At the bottom, it opens up into really big jumps. The combination of the top, the middle, and the bottom is what makes this event unique. Linking a clean run through the whole thing is no easy task. How did the riders respond to the course? Were there any surprises in how they approached it? Cam McCaul: The runs are long, and the features are big. The first course walk day, all the riders hiked around and realized that learning these lines would be something that would take time. Each rider approached practice differently and had their own process. One rider\u2019s approach that was insanely impressive (but not really surprising because he has done this before) was Dylan Stark. Dylan just wastes no time\u2026 He gets straight to the top of the course and does a T to B. Even if there are features that haven\u2019t been guinnea\u2019d yet, he just drops in and links a run. Natural Selection in snowboarding has a distinct judging format\u2014how did you translate that into mountain biking? Cam McCaul: It\u2019s called CREDO, which stands for Creativity, Risk, Execution, Difficulty, and Overall Impression. In all contests, I have a firm belief that the overall impression should matter most. It\u2019s a nice idea, but in a lot of cases, it falls apart because most events have pre-determined point deductions for things like slipped pedals, crashes, etc. At NST Bike, you can literally crash and get back up, and if the merit of the things that are done successfully is heavy enough, it\u2019s possible to bank a respectable score to build upon. In this event, there are two different trails, and the men\u2019s riders take one run on each. So the men have a combined score for the two different runs, with no throw-aways. This format really rewards consistency. Max score for run 1 is 50 points, max score for run 2 is 50 points. The highest combined score (out of a possible 100) after those two runs takes the cake. In the spirit of having the flexibility to make adjustments as needed to ensure things are done right, the decision was made by the Women\u2019s field to adjust their format from 2 runs to 1. Social media guy. Were there any specific moments that stood out to you as defining what this event is all about? Cam MCCaul: Absolutely\u2026 Finley Kirschenmann and Janelle Soukup. The timing of their trajectories as riders and how that converged with this event taking shape is super special. They both earned their invites through the \u201cDream Ticket\u201d qualifying event and then absolutely killed it in their final runs at Mt. Dewar. This event is probably more suited toward veteran riders with long histories in the sport because the venue and format are so demanding. Yet, these two have already racked up well-rounded backgrounds and diverse skill sets at a very young age, and they put it all on display with pressure. They really do represent an exciting glimpse into the future. Some of the best freeride events have a strong storytelling element\u2014how did you want this event to stand out in terms of visuals and coverage? I think from a \u201cstorytelling\u201d perspective, the story is simple. Create a couple of the most fun and challenging feature-filled trails on earth, get some of the best riders to take one run on each of the trails, shoot it like it\u2019s a film segment, and whoever kills it the most wins the event. When you\u2019re riding with your friends, you know who\u2019s ripping the hardest. This is just like that but elevated. There will be less controversy from viewers because there are fewer \u201capples to oranges\u201d comparisons going on, and it will be easier for recreational mountain bikers to relate and enjoy watching. It\u2019s not an anomaly\u2026It\u2019s mountain biking\u2026at a very high level, yes\u2026but it looks like mountain biking. Another thought, if you were to have a group of 10 riders ride one berm or one jump and then rank them 1-10 in order of who rode it best, it would be hard. Maybe you could easily determine who got first and who got last, but figuring out who placed 4th \u2013 8th would be insane. The fact that these lines at NST Queenstown are long, and you\u2019re being judged on two runs, creates more room for separation. It creates room for the strongest riders to rise to the surface but also more room for differentiation in the middle of the pack. Checking out the NST Track. This event seems to bridge the gap between backcountry freeride and competition\u2014do you think it represents a new path for mountain biking? Cam McCaul: This event is one iteration of the many different paths it can potentially take in the future. No one location or terrain type defines mountain biking or the \u201cfreeride\u201d side of mountain biking. If an event series is going to truly represent freeride mountain biking, the event series needs to be as versatile as the sport itself and able to experiment and evolve. Instead of saying it represents a \u201cnew path\u201d for mountain biking, I\u2019d say it represents a whole new \u201ctrail network\u201d of possibilities. Could you see Natural Selection growing into a multi-stop series like in snowboarding? If so, where would you love to see future events held? Cam McCaul: Heck yeah. I think each location that becomes home for future events will also dictate what type of format the event takes on, what riders get invited, etc. This Queenstown event is held on really challenging trails/jump lines, like Coronet Peak on steroids. Another event could be held in a desert zone with chutes, fade-aways, and cliff drops. There could be another event in the woods with wild freeride stunts connected by trail sections. Let your imagination run wild with the things that you love about mountain biking, and create a contest for it. That is what this is for. How do you think this format challenges riders differently than Rampage or the Fest Series? Cam McCaul: Rampage is a one-of-a-kind spectacle and is untouchable in terms of the box that it checks. Fest is a series of all-time jam sessions on huge jumps. Freeride can\u2019t be put into a box, so it makes more sense to have a lot of different boxes and figure out the right ways to check them. Cam McCaul, Proving Grounds, Pacific City, Oregon. What impact do you think this event could have on the next generation of freeriders? Cam McCaul: Riders will develop really well-rounded skill sets. What\u2019s something about organizing an event like this that people watching at home might not realize? Cam McCaul: Todd would be the right one to answer this in more detail, but from my perspective, it\u2019s the village of passionate and dedicated people working around the clock to make wildly ambitious ideas possible. From Todd\u2019s H5 Events to All Good Productions in NZ, to Rod Drury\u2019s TRAC non-profit, the NZ Government\u2019s tourism initiatives, the course builders at Elevate, the athlete advisory committee we have that consists of Cam Zink, Carson Storch, Casey Brown, and Emil Johansson, plus the whole crew I work with at Natural Selection who are simultaneously running events in 4 sports in the first 3 months of the year, it\u2019s absolutely incredible what\u2019s possible when you all feel like you\u2019re doing it for the right reasons. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to understand how much is going on behind the scenes until you get a peek behind the curtain. Were there any \u201coh sh*t\u201d moments during planning where you thought something might not come together? Cam McCaul: For me, the biggest \u201coh shit\u201d is realizing how many qualified athletes there are in our scene right now but how few spots there were on the invite list. That was the hardest part for me to be involved with. I\u2019ve sworn I would never judge an event, but here I am on a panel of people who are selecting the invited riders, knowing that there are inevitably going to be so many I want there that won\u2019t make it on the list. Being on a selection committee is almost worse than being a judge. Guess that\u2019s what I get. If you could pick one rider from any era of MTB history to drop into this event, who would it be and why? Cam McCaul: Any era? Ok, Kirt Voreis circa 1999. Because he rules and always has. Some of the Natural Selection Bike Crew.",

        "text": "PRESS RELEASE: Crankworx Mountain biking enthusiasts, mark your calendars: from February 13-16, Crankworx Summer Series New Zealand will transform \u014ctautahi Christchurch into the epicentre of gravity-fueled excitement. Against the breathtaking setting of Christchurch Adventure Park (CAP), riders from across the globe are set to converge for four days of high-stakes competition featuring three main events: Redemption Downhill, Pump Track Challenge, and New Zealand\u2019s first-ever FMB Gold Cup Slopestyle. While athlete registration remains open, the early rider list is already stacked with a mix of international stars and local heroes, promising an adrenaline-charged showcase of skill and determination. For the first time, athletes have the opportunity to earn valuable points towards the prestigious Crankworx World Tour Series and the coveted King & Queen of Crankworx titles by competing in the Pump Track Challenge and Redemption Downhill, solidifying the festival\u2019s significance on the global mountain bike stage. Spectators can catch all the action live on-site or watch the broadcast live on TV NZ or Pinkbike while aspiring competitors still have a chance to grab a spot before registration closes. Female Athletes to Watch The reigning Queen of Crankworx, Martha Gill, is among the top contenders heading to Christchurch. Gill\u2019s skill in both the Downhill and Pump Track disciplines makes her a favourite, though competition from Kiwi stars like Jenna Hastings, Sacha Earnest, and Shania Rawson will undoubtedly test her limits. Hastings, fresh off an impressive comeback season, Earnest, who finished the 2024 UCI DH season in 3rd place, and Rawson, recipient of the 2024 Crankworx Trail Blazer Award, bring local pride to the lineup. The Pump Track Challenge also introduces first-time Crankworx competitor and reigning UCI Pump Track World Champion Sabina Ko\u0161\u00e1rkov\u00e1 from the Czech Republic, adding international intrigue to an already stacked field. Other notable names include Louise Ferguson, a multi-discipline powerhouse shifting from Freeride to Downhill racing, and Jordy Scott, who narrowly missed the 2024 Queen title and is poised for redemption. Male Athletes to Watch New Zealand\u2019s dominance is palpable, with nearly a third of the confirmed male athletes hailing from Aotearoa. Lachie Stevens-McNab leads the charge after a breakout year, aiming to build on his RockShox Taniwha Downhill victory at Crankworx Rotorua 2024. Tuhoto-Ariki Pene, former King of Crankworx and Rotorua local, is joining him, eager to capitalize on \u2018home turf\u2019 advantage. International challengers include reigning King of Crankworx Ryan Gilchrist from Australia, who dominated the 2024 World Tour, his fellow countryman Jackson Frew, and British rider Bernard Kerr, bringing his signature style to the Redemption Downhill. Slopestyle Athletes to Look Out For Being the first of its calibre in Aotearoa, New Zealand, the FMB Gold Cup Slopestyle promises to deliver unforgettable moments. David Godziek, 2024 Slopestyle World Champion and Triple Crown winner, attends as the man to beat. Chasing him are heavy hitters from Europe like Erik Fedko and Lucas Huppert, as well as young Canadian talent like Griffin Paulson, Chance Moore, and Ben Thompson. The 2024 Red Bull Rookie of the Year and rising star Kaidan Ingersoll is poised to be a standout this season as he goes head-to-head with elite Crankworx Slopestyle World Championship (SWC) competitors. Red Bull athlete Patricia Druwen\u2019s return after a 2024 hiatus sets the stage for fierce competition in the women's division. Joining her are SWC riders Canadian Natasha Miller and USA\u2019s Shealen Reno, the first-ever female Slopestyle World Champion. Adding to the anticipation, the Christchurch Gold Cup Slopestyle will host first-time competitor Kirsten Van Horne from Canada. This promising dark horse has already showcased impressive skills and undeniable potential, setting the stage to disrupt the competition while carving out her place on the international circuit. Van Horne will also be vying for one of the coveted wildcards to the Maxxis Slopestyle at Crankworx Rotorua, adding an extra layer of stakes to her debut. Beyond the Races The festival kicks off on February 13 with a Jump Jam at CAP\u2019s iconic Mulchy Jump, bringing local and international riders together in a spectacle of flips, whips, and style. This event also marks the beginning of a strong partnership between Crankworx and Christchurch, highlighting the city\u2019s potential as a world-class mountain biking destination. After a day of race action, athletes and spectators can cycle into town and enjoy dinner at The Terrace , where they will find some of the city's best restaurants and bars, set along the \u014ct\u0101karo/Avon River. With its colourful, Spanish Mission-style architecture, New Regent Street is a hot tip, boasting an abundance of places to eat and drink in an amazing setting. Riverside Market is another favourite spot, with options for all tastes and temptations. Whether you\u2019re a spectator, rider, or fan of the sport, Crankworx Summer Series Christchurch promises non-stop action and unforgettable moments of local talent rubbing shoulders with international top riders.

        "author": "TEBP",
        "date": "03-07-2025",
        "text": "BIKE CHECK Lean Cycles P1 Prototype Photography by TEBP In the beginning there was beer. Beer, bikes, two friends who were studying mechanical engineering and the will to design a bike unrestricted from commercial market demands. Robert and Luca were at the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW) when they had the idea to build a bike based on everything they had learned at university and their previous jobs. Luckily, their tutor was a bike nerd too and allowed Luca to make this bike his master's thesis. The Lean Cycles P1 prototype is a wild mix of 3D printed steel parts, machined aluminum, welding, brazing, a progressive high pivot suspension design and - last but not least - a belt-driven gearbox. Robert and Luca founded a small company which enabled them to apply for research funding from Innosuisse. Their friend Kilian joined them later in the process, so Lean Cycles is now a team of three friends. From the beginning, they always wanted to create a bike with a very light rear end to reduce the unsprung mass. At the same time, a high progression suspension design was on the list too, which was designed around a coil shock. Thanks to the massive uni-piece swingarm, they don't need a frame splitter to install the Gates belt. The geometry is full custom of course: - Reach: 480 mm - Stack: 635 mm - Wheelbase: 1272 mm - Seat angle: 77.5\u00b0 - Head angle: 63\u00b0 - Chain stays: 445 mm - BB height: 345 mm The goal was to push the boundaries of frame design to a new level using modern development and manufacturing processes, without being driven by commercial market\u00a0demands. \u2014 Luca from Lean\u00a0Cycles The tubing is Reynolds 931. Luca says that it's really good for joining processes and double butted. It's the same material as the 3D printed parts, which is needed to get the best results in his opinion. The machined swingarm is made from rather rare 2099 aluminum. Luca says that it contains quite a lot of copper and lithium, which makes it stiffer and even lighter than other aluminum alloys. It's so rare that he had to get some help from his tutor to source it. It's also around 10x more expensive than other alloys, so it wouldn't be a viable option for a serial production bike. As this was a master's thesis at a Swiss university, it wouldn't have been enough to \"just\" make a frame. Of course there had to be a very analytical part too. To learn more about the strength of the welded and brazed parts, they made some mockups and put these in test machines. After that, Luca and Robert cut the joints open and inspected them with a microscope. This gave them valuable insights for the the welding and brazing processes for the actual frame. To make sure the frame would survive proper enduro riding, they got in touch with testing lab EFBE from Germany, which provided the team with data from its downhill testing program. All the calculations and assumptions they made are based on the EFBE DH test. For the 3D printed parts, they used topology optimization and the inputs they got from EFBE. It was a long(ish) process, as they did the calculations for every single part first and after that for the whole frame. The swingarm was also designed using topology optimization, that's why it doesn't look symmetrical. When all the calculations were done, FHNW did the machining and a partner company in Switzerland printed the other parts. The frame wouldn't exist without Zurich framebuilding legend Wim Kolb, who helped them to weld and braze the frame and who also helped them a lot during the whole process. Brake levers from Oak Components. It's not often that you see a stem that matches the dropper post. Funding from Innosuisse allowed the Lean Cycles team to get some 3D printed parts from a Swiss company. The lug is brazed at the seat tube and welded at the top tube. Luca hopes that the small grooves in the 3D printed parts can help to reduce stress concentrations. As this was the first bike they ever built, they tested their suspension design with Lego models first. No frame splitter needed on this bike to install the belt drive. How progressive? Yes. What will the future hold for Lean Cycles? One thing is for sure: They won't sell this bike. Their main goal was to build their dream bike, to showcase their abilities and how modern technology can help to create outstanding bikes. Luca, Robert and Kilian from Lean Cycles would like to thank FHNW, Wim Kolb, Pinion, DT Swiss and Oak Components for their help.",

        "text": "Behold, the visions of the seer. More radial tires. Schwalbe beat the competition to the punch with their radial tire release, but I don't think things will settle with that first release. The concept has legs, and the ride quality the tires offer seems to impress everyone that has a chance to ride them. As far as I understand it, the concept isn\u2019t under patent protection, and can be iterated with various thread counts and casing approaches beyond the basic orientation change. I for one am stoked to see what the rubber wizards do with the idea over the next year or two. More downhill bikes. I think we\u2019re going to see a few brands that historically haven\u2019t offered a standalone downhill bike come to market with race bikes. My reasoning for this guess is as such: The DH World Cup is aiming to be a more premier and \u201cimportant\u201d series, with participants theoretically getting focused screen time and consistent results. That should encourage any brand with assets to spend to consider entering the ring, and offering their own ride for athletes to showcase. Add to that the supposedly democratized Continental series that the UCI has announced, and you\u2019ll have a burgeoning market of aspiring racers looking for a solid race bike. DH bikes have never been a massive market, and of late if feels like most people are gravitating towards pedal-friendly machines, but this revised take on professional racing could stoke some competition on the brand end. Stronger brakes. The SRAM Mavens are the most powerful commonly available brakes on the market at this point, by some margin. Raw power isn\u2019t the end-all be-all, but a high bar has been set for that one parameter, so I\u2019d venture a guess that we\u2019ll see more attempts at that accolade. Whether or not this is something you\u2019re on the hunt for, I think the benefits come to light once you\u2019ve had the chance to try something that can fundamentally change the way you approach braking, opening up new lines and speeds. Integrated complication. Last year I staked my claim on user-changeable frame stiffness being an increasingly common element on production bikes. While that didn\u2019t catch on quite yet, I still think that\u2019s on deck. I may be recycling from last year's list, but I still feel this one coming, so here's it is again.",

Costa Brava serves as a mecca for BMX, inline skating, and scooters, while La Poma attracts dirt jumpers from around the globe during winter. Its unique urban architecture provides endless opportunities for creative riders. For Adrien Loron, Barcelona is more than just a destination\u2014it\u2019s a second home. Years ago, he and his friends would escape the cold by spending weeks riding the city. Now, Adrien spends half the year there, using the city\u2019s countless staircases as his training ground for the Urban Downhill World Tour. This latest video project was a chance for Adrien to push his riding to the next level. His goal was to explore the urban environment in new ways, unlocking fresh lines and tackling unique spots. By switching between different bikes, he was able to make the most of each location and adapt to the challenges they presented. Years of exploring the city made scouting easier, but the project still demanded lots of creativity, precision, and courage. A wooden ramp, a couple of motivated friends, and a lot of determination were all it took to turn his ideas into reality. The pressure while riding these spots was real. In Catalu\u00f1a, police patrols are constant, and riding in open public spaces isn\u2019t always understood. You have to be quick\u2014visualize the stunt, set up fast, and go. Sometimes, it\u2019s a one-shot deal with no room for mistakes. Every spot has a story, and every shot feels like a\u00a0victory. \u2014 Adrien\u00a0Loron The project wasn\u2019t without its challenges. Some of the wildest ideas didn\u2019t pan out, but Adrien and his team still managed to capture unforgettable moments. This experience also deepened Adrien\u2019s love for street riding, and he\u2019s already planning more projects like this in the future. Special thanks to Adrien's friends, without whom the video project could not have been realized: Pipe Vergara | Mati Rojas | Vitor Buchli",

        "title": "Review: MET's New Revo MIPS Helmet",
        "author": "Jessie-May Morgan",
        "date": "03-10-2025",
        "text": "MET Helmets have announced an all-new open face helmet, the Revo MIPS. It replaces the Roam helmet with a construction that offers improved ventilation over that predecessor. Highlights on this one include the impressively deep coverage at the rear, a good range of adjustment, and the quiet two-piece MIPS Air Node Liner. The Air Node liner deals with the rotational forces in an impact, while the polycarbonate-covered EPS takes care of more direct forces. On top of the obligatory CE, AZ/NZS and US safety certifications required to sell the helmet in those respective regions, the MET Revo MIPS conforms to the more recently introduced NTA safety standard required for Speed Pedelec, or e-bikes that provide assistance up to 45 km/h. Another stamp of approval for this helmet comes from independent helmet testers, Virginia Tech; a 5-Star rating is the highest rating possible, indicating that of the hundreds of helmets vying for your money, this is one of the safer options.

The Revo MIPS is a 5-Star rated helmet, receiving a score of 10.45 from Virginia Tech. The lower the score, the safer the helmet. A score of 10.45 puts it at #38 in the rankings, as compared to the 7.23 score of the current #1 , the Fox Speedframe Pro RS . Granted, the Speedframe Pro RS is considerably more expensive at $279 USD. However, it is worth highlighting that there are twelve mountain bike helmets that have received a lower (safer) score from Virginia Tech that come with a smaller price tag than the Revo MIPS. Performance & Construction The MET Revo MIPS has an in-mold construction with a single-density EPS. The coverage is notably very deep at the rear providing a little more than the Rogue Core helmet from sister brand Bluegrass. There are 23 vents distributed around the polycarbonate shell with deep ventilation channels visible on the inside leading to large exhaust vents at the rear. I won\u2019t comment too much on how well ventilated a helmet is owing to my having a lot of hair, but I can tell you that MET go to great lengths to objectively test how cool their helmets are. Their in-house testing includes use of a wind tunnel and a head dummy heated to 38\u00b0C. By measuring changes in temperature of the dummy, the design engineers can determine what combination of vents and airflow channels delivers the best cooling effect. Inside we have a MIPS Air Node Liner, the function of which is to reduce concussive rotational forces during an impact. There are a multitude of MIPS liners, some of which can creak as they rub against the EPS shell. Happily, this Air Node variation is very quiet. It's also one of the lightest options going, combining the air pockets of the MIPS system with the comfort liner itself. On the Revo, the Air Node Liner is a two-piece affair. Due to the deep coverage a second liner was required for the occipital portion of the shell to ensure that the rotational impact protection adequately extends to that rear portion. RETENTION & ADJUSTMENTS My head circumference is 54cm putting me in the middle of the range of the size small I tested. While its features offer a good range of usable adjustment, for me, this is not the most comfortable and well-fitting helmet. I experienced pressure points at each side toward the rear of my head. I think the shape of the venting channels in this area narrows the helmet a bit. I prefer the fit of the Bluegrass Rogue Core which gives an even pressure everywhere. While the pressure points are evident initially I will say they aren't so prominent that I\u2019m aware of them while riding. The head belt is a full wrap on the Revo so it tightens evenly when you cinch it down. It tightens from the back though so the smaller you make it the further the shell's position will be biased toward the front of your head. The dial on the cradle is a decent size so not too fiddly to adjust. The occipital height adjustment doesn't run on a ratchet system which is absolutely a good thing. In my experience those can slip when trails get rough resulting in the helmet's position shifting while riding, or while putting goggles on, requiring constant re-adjustment. With the more basic poppet design like that seen here on the Revo the retention system stays put. The visor has four indexed positions owing to an attachment point at the center that runs on a ratchet. It is reasonably flexible, designed to breakaway on impact to reduce rotational forces. That said, the fact that it is secured by three attachments instead of two likely means more force would be required before it broke away from the helmet body. Extremes of the visor position. Note: The Revo MIPS has a good range of occipital height adjustment. Here, I have it positioned with a rearward bias. I found the middle position to give a better fit, rotating the shell forward a little to give more coverage at the front. At the other end of the range, the front of the shell basically sits on my eyebrows. The MET Revo does offer storage for sunglasses though how secure it is will depend on the sunglasses themselves. The glasses I tested the helmet with don't have rubber on the arms for extra security so the glasses will bounce around and run the risk of falling out when riding over bumps. I guess helmet manufacturers could take matters into their own hands by providing rubber inserts against the wall of the ventilation channels to better grip the arms of the glasses. Importantly, the arms are able to slot all the way into the vents without contacting my head. PRICE At $230 USD, the MET Revo is one of the more expensive MIPS-equipped helmets that money can buy. I will mention again that there are twelve more affordable helmets ranked by Virginia Tech that have been award a lower (safer) score - like the $110 USD Specialized Tactic (Score: 8.55) which to my mind is still one of the best value mountain bike helmets money can buy. WEIGHT Claimed weight for the MET Revo MIPS in a size small is 370g; ours weighed in at 368 grams. That's fairly middle of the road, and on a par with the more expensive Fox Speedframe RS, Virginia Tech's top ranked MTB helmet, which gets the more advanced MIPS Integra Split. It's not particularly light, but with the deep coverage this helmet offers I wouldn't really expect it to be. Pros + Design prioritizes ventilation + Good range of usable adjustments + Space for sunglasses storage + No creaking + 5-Star Rating from Virginia Tech Cons - I experienced pressure points - There are lots of less expensive helmets with a better safety rating from Virginia Tech Pinkbike's Take The MET Revo Mips is a quality open-face helmet with a design that prioritizes ventilation. While its shape isn't the most comfortable for my head shape, the retention system does offer a good range of adjustment for dialing in the fit, and the sunglasses storage is a nice feature. While I am sure it will be a solid option for many, for me there isn't anything particularly standout about the Revo. It will be hard to justify purchasing this helmet over less expensive options that have performed better in independent safety tests. \u2014 Jessie-May\u00a0Morgan",
