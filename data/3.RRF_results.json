The energy in the crowd was electric, especially as Kiwi athletes took to the track in this chainless head-to-head showdown. No stranger to the Crankworx World Tour Jackson Frew won his first ever Pump Track gold medal, while his female counterpart Laura Smulders is a brand-new face to the Crankworx family. As Round 2 of the 2025 Crankworx Pump Track Series, the stakes were high, with riders pushing their limits on the technical and fast course. In the women\u2019s final, Dutch racers Manon Veenstra and Laura Smulders battled to the wire. Smulders edged out her fellow Dutchie Veenstra in a nail-biting finish, winning gold by just 0.007 seconds.

    "Ready to Ride: Crankworx Summer Series New Zealand Kicks Off the 2025 Season: PRESS RELEASE: Crankworx Mountain biking enthusiasts, mark your calendars: from February 13-16, Crankworx Summer Series New Zealand will transform \u014ctautahi Christchurch into the epicentre of gravity-fueled excitement. Against the breathtaking setting of Christchurch Adventure Park (CAP), riders from across the globe are set to converge for four days of high-stakes competition featuring three main events: Redemption Downhill, Pump Track Challenge, and New Zealand\u2019s first-ever FMB Gold Cup Slopestyle. While athlete registration remains open, the early rider list is already stacked with a mix of international stars and local heroes, promising an adrenaline-charged showcase of skill and determination. For the first time, athletes have the opportunity to earn valuable points towards the prestigious Crankworx World Tour Series and the coveted King & Queen of Crankworx titles by competing in the Pump Track Challenge and Redemption Downhill, solidifying the festival\u2019s significance on the global mountain bike stage. Spectators can catch all the action live on-site or watch the broadcast live on TV NZ or Pinkbike while aspiring competitors still have a chance to grab a spot before registration closes. Female Athletes to Watch The reigning Queen of Crankworx, Martha Gill, is among the top contenders heading to Christchurch. Gill\u2019s skill in both the Downhill and Pump Track disciplines makes her a favourite, though competition from Kiwi stars like Jenna Hastings, Sacha Earnest, and Shania Rawson will undoubtedly test her limits. Hastings, fresh off an impressive comeback season, Earnest, who finished the 2024 UCI DH season in 3rd place, and Rawson, recipient of the 2024 Crankworx Trail Blazer Award, bring local pride to the lineup. The Pump Track Challenge also introduces first-time Crankworx competitor and reigning UCI Pump Track World Champion Sabina Ko\u0161\u00e1rkov\u00e1 from the Czech Republic, adding international intrigue to an already stacked field. Other notable names include Louise Ferguson, a multi-discipline powerhouse shifting from Freeride to Downhill racing, and Jordy Scott, who narrowly missed the 2024 Queen title and is poised for redemption. Male Athletes to Watch New Zealand\u2019s dominance is palpable, with nearly a third of the confirmed male athletes hailing from Aotearoa. Lachie Stevens-McNab leads the charge after a breakout year, aiming to build on his RockShox Taniwha Downhill victory at Crankworx Rotorua 2024. Tuhoto-Ariki Pene, former King of Crankworx and Rotorua local, is joining him, eager to capitalize on \u2018home turf\u2019 advantage. International challengers include reigning King of Crankworx Ryan Gilchrist from Australia, who dominated the 2024 World Tour, his fellow countryman Jackson Frew, and British rider Bernard Kerr, bringing his signature style to the Redemption Downhill. Slopestyle Athletes to Look Out For Being the first of its calibre in Aotearoa, New Zealand, the FMB Gold Cup Slopestyle promises to deliver unforgettable moments. David Godziek, 2024 Slopestyle World Champion and Triple Crown winner, attends as the man to beat. Chasing him are heavy hitters from Europe like Erik Fedko and Lucas Huppert, as well as young Canadian talent like Griffin Paulson, Chance Moore, and Ben Thompson. The 2024 Red Bull Rookie of the Year and rising star Kaidan Ingersoll is poised to be a standout this season as he goes head-to-head with elite Crankworx Slopestyle World Championship (SWC) competitors. Red Bull athlete Patricia Druwen\u2019s return after a 2024 hiatus sets the stage for fierce competition in the women's division. Joining her are SWC riders Canadian Natasha Miller and USA\u2019s Shealen Reno, the first-ever female Slopestyle World Champion. Adding to the anticipation, the Christchurch Gold Cup Slopestyle will host first-time competitor Kirsten Van Horne from Canada. This promising dark horse has already showcased impressive skills and undeniable potential, setting the stage to disrupt the competition while carving out her place on the international circuit. Van Horne will also be vying for one of the coveted wildcards to the Maxxis Slopestyle at Crankworx Rotorua, adding an extra layer of stakes to her debut. Beyond the Races The festival kicks off on February 13 with a Jump Jam at CAP\u2019s iconic Mulchy Jump, bringing local and international riders together in a spectacle of flips, whips, and style. This event also marks the beginning of a strong partnership between Crankworx and Christchurch, highlighting the city\u2019s potential as a world-class mountain biking destination. After a day of race action, athletes and spectators can cycle into town and enjoy dinner at The Terrace , where they will find some of the city's best restaurants and bars, set along the \u014ct\u0101karo/Avon River. With its colourful, Spanish Mission-style architecture, New Regent Street is a hot tip, boasting an abundance of places to eat and drink in an amazing setting. Riverside Market is another favourite spot, with options for all tastes and temptations. Whether you\u2019re a spectator, rider, or fan of the sport, Crankworx Summer Series Christchurch promises non-stop action and unforgettable moments of local talent rubbing shoulders with international top riders.

    "Race Report: High-Speed Racing & Airtime at Crankworx Rotorua AirDH 2025: Words: Crankworx The 2025 Crankworx World Tour is officially underway, as Crankworx Rotorua kicked off five days of adrenaline-fuelled action at Skyline Rotorua with the AirDH, returning the festival to a single epic venue for the first time in years. With world-class athletes, passionate fans, and a stacked schedule, including the RockShox K\u0101rearea Downhill, Maxxis Slopestyle in Memory of McGazza, Pump Track Challenge, and Specialized Dual Slalom events ahead, the stage is set for another historic year of competition.

Notably, the YETI team delivered a dominant performance in the men\u2019s race, locking out the entire podium while being represented by Camilla Balanche on the women\u2019s side. Ryan Gilchrist Backs Up Last Year\u2019s Victory After securing his 2024 King of Crankworx title and backing it up with a win at Crankworx Summer Series Christchurch earlier this year, Ryan Gilchrist showed no signs of slowing down, taking the gold medal at the Crankworx Rotorua AirDH for the second year in a row.

    "Race Report: Crankworx Rotorua Ends with a Bang After New Courses & New Challenges: Crankworx Rotorua 2025 wrapped up with high-speed head-to-head action at the Specialized Dual Slalom, as athletes tackled a brand-new, repurposed Speed & Style course at Skyline Rotorua. The challenging terrain and uncertain bike choice made for an intense day of racing, pushing riders to their limits. Caroline Buchanan Takes Gold Over Jordy Scott In the women\u2019s final, former Queen of Crankworx, Caroline Buchanan faced Jordy Scott in a dramatic battle. Scott held a 0.237-second advantage going into the second run, but Buchanan\u2019s acceleration in the final flat section proved too strong, allowing her to clinch victory. Adding to her remarkable win, Buchanan was forced to race on an unfamiliar bike after her Dual Slalom bike was stolen just a week before arriving in Rotorua. \u201cThis course was so technical. Shark fin features that really threw a different element to the racing today\u201d, Caroline Buchanan about the new course. The small final saw Pump Track Champion Sabina Ko\u0161\u00e1rkov\u00e1 grab her second bronze medal of the festival, after also finishing third in the Pump Track Challenge earlier this week. In her first-ever Crankworx Dual Slalom, Ko\u0161\u00e1rkov\u00e1 defeated young Canadian Slopestyle standout Natasha Miller, who slipped on the final left-hand berm, sealing Ko\u0161\u00e1rkov\u00e1\u2019s podium spot.

Laura Smulders (NED) Ryan Gilchrist Defends 2024 Victory In a nail-biting gold medal battle against Sam Blenkinsop, Ryan Gilchrist emerged victorious despite a tricky first run where he nearly missed the final gates. Gilchrist came back strong, laying down the fastest time of the day at 19.961 seconds - a significant gap over the second-fastest run by Tuhoto-Ariki Pene (20.305s). With this, he secured back-to-back victories in Rotorua, defending his 2024 Specialized Dual Slalom gold and once again displayed his prowess and pedal power. Kiwi rider Sam Blenkinsop showcased that after several years of racing within the Crankworx circuit, he is still a force to be reckoned with and not to be counted out of the battle for the 2025 crown. In the bronze medal match, Gilchrist\u2019s YETI teammate Richie Rude faced off against local hero and 2023 King of Crankworx, Tuhoto-Ariki Pene. Pene, in a dramatic turn, missed the final gates and was disqualified, awarding Rude with a bronze medal in his first-ever Crankworx Dual Slalom. Men\u2019s Podium: 1. Ryan Gilchrist (AUS) 2.

    "Bike Check: Lean Cycles P1 Prototype: BIKE CHECK Lean Cycles P1 Prototype Photography by TEBP In the beginning there was beer. Beer, bikes, two friends who were studying mechanical engineering and the will to design a bike unrestricted from commercial market demands. Robert and Luca were at the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW) when they had the idea to build a bike based on everything they had learned at university and their previous jobs. Luckily, their tutor was a bike nerd too and allowed Luca to make this bike his master's thesis. The Lean Cycles P1 prototype is a wild mix of 3D printed steel parts, machined aluminum, welding, brazing, a progressive high pivot suspension design and - last but not least - a belt-driven gearbox. Robert and Luca founded a small company which enabled them to apply for research funding from Innosuisse. Their friend Kilian joined them later in the process, so Lean Cycles is now a team of three friends. From the beginning, they always wanted to create a bike with a very light rear end to reduce the unsprung mass. At the same time, a high progression suspension design was on the list too, which was designed around a coil shock. Thanks to the massive uni-piece swingarm, they don't need a frame splitter to install the Gates belt. The geometry is full custom of course: - Reach: 480 mm - Stack: 635 mm - Wheelbase: 1272 mm - Seat angle: 77.5\u00b0 - Head angle: 63\u00b0 - Chain stays: 445 mm - BB height: 345 mm The goal was to push the boundaries of frame design to a new level using modern development and manufacturing processes, without being driven by commercial market\u00a0demands. \u2014 Luca from Lean\u00a0Cycles The tubing is Reynolds 931. Luca says that it's really good for joining processes and double butted. It's the same material as the 3D printed parts, which is needed to get the best results in his opinion. The machined swingarm is made from rather rare 2099 aluminum. Luca says that it contains quite a lot of copper and lithium, which makes it stiffer and even lighter than other aluminum alloys. It's so rare that he had to get some help from his tutor to source it. It's also around 10x more expensive than other alloys, so it wouldn't be a viable option for a serial production bike. As this was a master's thesis at a Swiss university, it wouldn't have been enough to \"just\" make a frame. Of course there had to be a very analytical part too. To learn more about the strength of the welded and brazed parts, they made some mockups and put these in test machines. After that, Luca and Robert cut the joints open and inspected them with a microscope. This gave them valuable insights for the the welding and brazing processes for the actual frame. To make sure the frame would survive proper enduro riding, they got in touch with testing lab EFBE from Germany, which provided the team with data from its downhill testing program. All the calculations and assumptions they made are based on the EFBE DH test. For the 3D printed parts, they used topology optimization and the inputs they got from EFBE. It was a long(ish) process, as they did the calculations for every single part first and after that for the whole frame. The swingarm was also designed using topology optimization, that's why it doesn't look symmetrical. When all the calculations were done, FHNW did the machining and a partner company in Switzerland printed the other parts. The frame wouldn't exist without Zurich framebuilding legend Wim Kolb, who helped them to weld and braze the frame and who also helped them a lot during the whole process. Brake levers from Oak Components. It's not often that you see a stem that matches the dropper post. Funding from Innosuisse allowed the Lean Cycles team to get some 3D printed parts from a Swiss company. The lug is brazed at the seat tube and welded at the top tube. Luca hopes that the small grooves in the 3D printed parts can help to reduce stress concentrations. As this was the first bike they ever built, they tested their suspension design with Lego models first. No frame splitter needed on this bike to install the belt drive. How progressive? Yes. What will the future hold for Lean Cycles? One thing is for sure: They won't sell this bike. Their main goal was to build their dream bike, to showcase their abilities and how modern technology can help to create outstanding bikes. Luca, Robert and Kilian from Lean Cycles would like to thank FHNW, Wim Kolb, Pinion, DT Swiss and Oak Components for their help."
