      "Race Face's new Turbine pedal may carry a familiar silhouette, but there are some key details to set them apart from the crowd. Race Face is touting these as the grippiest and most concave pedal on the market, pulling out all the stops to try to achieve those benchmarks.\n",
      "\n",
      "With 11 pins per side and a concave shape in both the fore-aft and port-starboard directions, they do everything they can to keep your feet from budging.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turbine Details\n",
      "• 6061 Aluminum body\n",
      "• 115mm L x 110mm W\n",
      "• 11 pins per side, height adjustable\n",
      "• Dual concavity\n",
      "• 7 colors\n",
      "• Weight: 416g actual\n",
      "• Price: $180 USD, $220 CAD, €199 EUR\n",
      "• raceface.com\n",
      "\n",
      "Turbine\n",
      "0 seconds of 2 minutes, 51 seconds\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast to Race Face's other top-tier pedal, the Atlas, the Turbines feature no bearing bump, and instead house all the spinny bits inside the pedal body. This allows for a narrower Q-factor (effective pedaling width), and keeps the shoe tight to the crank as a reference if you do happen to put a foot down through a tricky section. The Turbines use inboard bushings and outboard bearings to carry the load, and have been proven on the test rig as plenty durable - we'll see how that shakes out in time through real-world conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the event that things do get loose or sticky, the internals are fully serviceable, and replacement parts will be available. Like all of Race Face's parts, the Turbine pedals are backed by their lifetime warranty, which includes crash damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Turbines are heavily concave, in line with other deeply cupped pedals on the market like the Deity T-Mac. That pedal has long been a favorite of people who dig the locked-in feel, and definitely served as a benchmark for the design of this Race Face alternative. RF quotes the Turbines as being 17% more concave, 27 grams lighter, and only 5% thicker than the T-Mac, so clearly they've considered the competition. Deity quotes the T-Mac platform as being 2.5mm deep, while the Turbines are 3mm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Race Face gave the pedals some additional bite by going with full-on pins as opposed to grub screws, for maximum grip at the shoe. Having gone back and forth between pins and screws in the past, the difference is definitely noticeable, regardless of shoe choice. The pins extend 6mm past the pedal body, and the pedals ship with a full set of washers, should you want to shorten them. Some flat pedal aficionados vouch for threaded pins rather than straight-sided ones, but it's not as if the latter won't work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seriously toothy pins, loaded from the back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fattest portion of the pedal is 20mm thick, not including pins, meaning the Turbines won't be winning any thinness competitions. That said, they've taken some steps to reduce the number of pedal strikes you'll experience, via an asymmetrical overall shape and chamfered leading edges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Steve on the stunts.\n",
      "Seven colors for your matching pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Turbines are available now, priced at $180.00 USD / $220.00 CAD / 199 EUR SRP / $295 AUD. More info is available at the Race Face website.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ride Impressions\n",
      "\n",
      "I've only had a few rides on the Turbines so far, but you can get a pretty good feel for grip and platform feel right off the bat. Durability is another matter, so we'll see how well these survive in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately apparent is the locked-in feel these provide, which I'd put on par with just about any other pair of flats I've run in the past. I rode with T-Macs for years, and found they worked very well, but pins are definitely a bit more secure feeling than grub screws, should shoe bite be your ultimate concern. For folks that like to smear around on the pedals to reposition a foot, the Turbines are going to provide a challenge, but that's why options are nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other comparable designs are: the North Shore Billet Daemons, which have a very similar pin layout, but slightly less concavity; the Chromag Dagga, which has similarly aggressive pins, though with more in the center and a sharper bite; and the Burgtec Penthouse B-Rage, which are equally concave, though with those distinct center pins to support the middle of the foot. I think we're due for another Flat Pedal Group Test, with all the new options cropping up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grippy.\n",
      "\n",
      "For now, I'll say this - the Turbines are plenty grippy for my purposes, and feel fairly natural despite the deeply concave shape. With a reasonably stiff pair of flat pedal shoes, you don't feel like your foot is being forced into an unnatural shape, and it's pretty easy to find center when your foot inevitably leaves the sweet spot. I find that sweet spot is a bit smaller with deeply concave pedals like these or the T-Macs, but once you're in it they tend to do a very good job of keeping you there.\n",
