Velo Podcast: Sleeping with a Scorpion: An Interview with 2024 Tour Divide Winner Meaghan Hackinen Words - Mike Levy Some of you like to pedal up the hill. Some of you like to go down the hill. Some of you like to race your bike for a few hours. And some of you… Well, some of you like to race your bike for over 4,000 kilometres through sand, snow, hopefully, more than a little bit of sun, and everything else in between. Today, Mike Levy talks to Meaghan Hackinen. Meaghan won the 2024 Tour Divide, and she’s also a two-time 24-hour world-time trial champion, which sounds absolutely insane. We’re going to talk about those things, and we’re also going to get to sleeping alone in grizzly country, waking up to a scorpion, strategies for doing these ultra-distance events by yourself, and Levy might have even slipped in a UFO question or two.

       "  'BC Bike Race Introduces New eMTB Categories For 2025 Event: Photo: Riders enjoy the trails at Maple Mountain in North Cowichan, BC, during the MegaVolt eMTB Festival, the first ebike event put on by BC Bike Race. PRESS RELEASE: BC Bike Race For the first time ever, the BC Bike Race has opened registration to e-bikers for the 2025 edition of the race. Remaining true to its roots as an innovator in the mountain bike events space, BCBR will be the first multi-day stage race in North America to launch an e-bike category. This follows on the heels of other international events, such as the Wines2Whales in South Africa and the Volcanic Epic in New Zealand. “This has been our minds for nearly 10 years since a few German racers asked us why we don’t have a category for eMTB. North America was then and still is about 10 years behind the European adoption of electric bikes. We believe it’s time to start including them in our\\xa0event.” — Andreas Hestler, Co-founder and Marketing Director for BC Bike\\xa0Race Dubbed the eBCBR, the new category will be open to both SL and full-power eMTBs and will run as a separate and concurrent event. This means the race will NOT mix electric and acoustic on the course at the same time and will create a schedule that gives both rider groups The Ultimate Singletrack Experience. There will also be an untimed option for those who want to ride the course without the pressure of a timing chip. The Journey to This Latest Evolution: BC Bike Race has always evolved alongside the Mountain Bike Industry. At our inception in 2007, the majority of bikes were aluminum hardtails with 26-inch wheels, and there wasn’t a dropper post in sight. Over time, carbon became the norm, full suspension took over, gear ratios grew, and good rubber started to hit the ground. As bikes evolved, the BCBR course has evolved, incorporating more singletrack and more technical terrain. BCBR gives racers the most, and arguably the best, singletrack of any stage race in the world. Now, there are eMountain Bikes. Embracing the history, growth and development of mountain biking, the BC Bike Race is evolving to give more people the chance to enjoy The Ultimate Singletrack Experience. More About the eBCBR: Date: June 30 – July 6th, 2025 Location: Vancouver Island – British Columbia Stage 1 – Victoria Stage 2 – Victoria Stage 3 – Cowichan Valley Stage 4 – Nanaimo Stage 5 – Cumberland Stage 6 – Campbell River Stage 7 – Cumberland BC Bike Race website Photo Credits : Dave Silver',\n",

Prevost DH Combine Invitational: Thank you to Stevie Smith Foundation, Municipality of North Cowichan, All-In Paramedic Services, all the pro riders, Aedan Skinner, Natalie Carrier, Oakley Salvisburg and all our volunteer course marshalls, and shuttle drivers for supporting the event and making it a success. Words by Holly Krasnuik and Darren Burns Photos by Jake Paddon and Natalie Carriere Video by Aedan Skinner What began years ago as a casual campfire chat between Canadian pro DH athletes McKay Vezina and Mark Wallace has now become a reality: Canada’s first-ever Downhill Mountain Bike Combine. The Cowichan Trail Stewardship Society in partnership with Stereo Racing hosted the first annual Downhill Mountain Bike Racing Combine Invitational on Mount Prevost in Duncan BC on November 1-3, 2024. Combines are a traditional method for teams and sports to find and develop new talent; which tests athletic skills such as speed, power, strength (mental and physical) and agility to identify future top players for the sport. The goal was to facilitate an event that would connect industry and unsigned U15-U17 Canadian riders in a meaningful, personal way that would result in a first hand learning experience about racing on the World Cup circuit. Parent participation was an integral portion of the event as we wanted to help facilitate an experience for supporting family members that helped garner awareness about the realistic expectations of what a professional career for their children encompasses. This year’s participants were 13 of BC’s fastest riders between the ages of 14 and 16 who have a goal of one day competing in the World Cup Circuit. These athletes were invited due to their performance at the 2024 BC/Canada Cups. The weekends events included: Friday: Meet and greet. Pro rider led Course inspection. Saturday: closed course practice on a taped course with 12 marshals on Mt.Prevost “Race Trail” Saturday evening: Q&A Panel with 8x industry professionals including UCI Team managers, nutritionist, Sports Physiotherapist, Performance coach and pro athletes. Sunday: Timed training and race run It was great to see how excited the riders and their families were to be there this weekend. It shows the value of what we are trying to do and already has us thinking about next\\xa0year! — Mark\\xa0Wallace Working with Holly and Mark on the Prevost Combine was a real privilege. As a trail society, being able to provide a platform and a trail for an event like this to take place is extremely rewarding. Our hope is that the Prevost Combine created a stepping stone for these extremely talented and dedicated kids to be able to take their riding careers to the next level. It was a pleasure connecting with the participants, their families, and all the volunteers that contributed time to this unique\\xa0event. — Lorrie Mansey, CTSS Executive\\xa0Director About the organizers: The Cowichan Trail Stewardship Society was founded and incorporated as a nonprofit organization in 2013 and currently builds, maintains and advocates for excellent mountain biking and hiking trails in the Cowichan Valley; namely on Mt Prevost, Mt Tzouhalem, and Maple Mountain. With more than a decade of industry experience, Stereo Racing is dedicated to coming up with creative solutions to amplify and enhance the meaningful impact and sustainable development of mountain biking both locally and globally.  We are committed to cultivating a pathway for Canadian athletes, nurturing their talent, and fostering a culture that embodies the heart of mountain bike culture in Canada. We strive to empower our team members by instilling values of perseverance, resilience, dedication, and self-respect, to not only excel in racing but also in life.

       "  \"Race Report: New Zealand’s 2025 Enduro MTB National Championships: Words: Cable Bay Enduro The Cable Bay Enduro and New Zealand Enduro MTB National Championships took place over the weekend at the Cable Bay Adventure Park in Nelson, offering riders three exhilarating days of practice and racing under perfect weather conditions. The event, now in its sixth edition, featured eight challenging stages spread across two days, with a half-day of practice and racing on Saturday, followed by a full day of competition on Sunday. Saturday's action commenced with shuttled practice sessions on the initial stages, allowing riders to familiarise themselves with the terrain before tackling the first three timed stages later in the day. The atmosphere was electric, with participants ranging from first-time racers to seasoned professionals, all eager to make their mark on the national championship course. For racing, riders were given a short shuttle before pedalling through some of Cable Bay Adventure Park's most lush terrain. Stage one for this year was The Poacher, a new trail which opened for last year’s event. The trail includes a big rock roll, which this year claimed a few riders who were pushing hard to beat the clock. Stage 2 was a short but punchy stage, which had been left with minimal catches after practice. It was a fine line between getting through unscathed and pushing too hard and blowing corners out, with some finding the limit. To finish day 1 of racing riders descended Veto and were met by over 300+ spectators, many of whom were dressed up with the hope of winning the Soundboks Go speaker that was up for grabs. Sunday's full day of racing encompassed five additional stages, each presenting its own set of technical challenges and demanding terrains. Riders navigated a cumulative elevation gain of approximately 1600 meters over 30 kilometres and over 2000 metres of descents. The well-maintained trails of Cable Bay Adventure Park, combined with the favourable weather, provided ideal racing conditions. However, as the day went on, the heat began to take its toll. The opening stage for Day 2 was a brand new trail which opened for the event. The trail, named The Courthouse, certainly served up some challenges as riders descended deep into the valley floor. The Courthouse was not only the longest descent of the weekend, but it included the steepest sections as well. Following stage 4, riders were on their own with no more shuttle assistance. Stage 5 was a park favourite CCR into Lost Time, followed by Stage 6, Broken Gnome, Stage 7, Missing Link into Jurassic, before tackling the final Stage 8, PineIine. Crossing the finish line, riders were handed a cold refreshment thanks to the team at Two Thumb Brewery before watching the remainder of the field tackle the stage. As times were confirmed, riders enjoyed more refreshments and a buffet meal to conclude an epic weekend of riding. With the sun still shining, the awards ceremony was one to remember as riders, sponsors and volunteers were celebrated for all their efforts. The winners of the Under 19 and Elite divisions were as follows: Elite Men: 1st Place: Brady Stone (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Joe Millington 3rd Place: Lachie Ross Elite Women: 1st Place: Xanthe Robb (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Winni Goldsbury 3rd Place: Zoe Trolove Under 19 Men: 1st Place: Eli Robertson (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Nico Schroder 3rd Place: Seppy Binsbergen Under 19 Women: 1st Place: Lucy Kemp (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Iley Nunns Full results here The Cable Bay Enduro continues to solidify its reputation as a premier event on New Zealand's mountain biking calendar, offering riders of all levels an opportunity to compete in a professionally organized and challenging environment. The success of this year's championships underscores the dedication of the organizers, volunteers, and sponsors in promoting the growth and recognition of Enduro mountain biking in New Zealand. For 2026, The Cable Bay Enduro will once more take place at Cable Bay Adventure Park and will certainly be an event not to miss as the organizers have some exciting plans taking shape.

The challenging terrain and uncertain bike choice made for an intense day of racing, pushing riders to their limits. Caroline Buchanan Takes Gold Over Jordy Scott In the women’s final, former Queen of Crankworx, Caroline Buchanan faced Jordy Scott in a dramatic battle. Scott held a 0.237-second advantage going into the second run, but Buchanan’s acceleration in the final flat section proved too strong, allowing her to clinch victory. Adding to her remarkable win, Buchanan was forced to race on an unfamiliar bike after her Dual Slalom bike was stolen just a week before arriving in Rotorua. “This course was so technical. Shark fin features that really threw a different element to the racing today”, Caroline Buchanan about the new course. The small final saw Pump Track Champion Sabina Košárková grab her second bronze medal of the festival, after also finishing third in the Pump Track Challenge earlier this week. In her first-ever Crankworx Dual Slalom, Košárková defeated young Canadian Slopestyle standout Natasha Miller, who slipped on the final left-hand berm, sealing Košárková’s podium spot.

Gilchrist came back strong, laying down the fastest time of the day at 19.961 seconds - a significant gap over the second-fastest run by Tuhoto-Ariki Pene (20.305s). With this, he secured back-to-back victories in Rotorua, defending his 2024 Specialized Dual Slalom gold and once again displayed his prowess and pedal power. Kiwi rider Sam Blenkinsop showcased that after several years of racing within the Crankworx circuit, he is still a force to be reckoned with and not to be counted out of the battle for the 2025 crown. In the bronze medal match, Gilchrist’s YETI teammate Richie Rude faced off against local hero and 2023 King of Crankworx, Tuhoto-Ariki Pene. Pene, in a dramatic turn, missed the final gates and was disqualified, awarding Rude with a bronze medal in his first-ever Crankworx Dual Slalom. Men’s Podium: 1. Ryan Gilchrist (AUS) 2.

       "  \"Ready to Ride: Crankworx Summer Series New Zealand Kicks Off the 2025 Season: PRESS RELEASE: Crankworx Mountain biking enthusiasts, mark your calendars: from February 13-16, Crankworx Summer Series New Zealand will transform Ōtautahi Christchurch into the epicentre of gravity-fueled excitement. Against the breathtaking setting of Christchurch Adventure Park (CAP), riders from across the globe are set to converge for four days of high-stakes competition featuring three main events: Redemption Downhill, Pump Track Challenge, and New Zealand’s first-ever FMB Gold Cup Slopestyle. While athlete registration remains open, the early rider list is already stacked with a mix of international stars and local heroes, promising an adrenaline-charged showcase of skill and determination. For the first time, athletes have the opportunity to earn valuable points towards the prestigious Crankworx World Tour Series and the coveted King & Queen of Crankworx titles by competing in the Pump Track Challenge and Redemption Downhill, solidifying the festival’s significance on the global mountain bike stage. Spectators can catch all the action live on-site or watch the broadcast live on TV NZ or Pinkbike while aspiring competitors still have a chance to grab a spot before registration closes. Female Athletes to Watch The reigning Queen of Crankworx, Martha Gill, is among the top contenders heading to Christchurch. Gill’s skill in both the Downhill and Pump Track disciplines makes her a favourite, though competition from Kiwi stars like Jenna Hastings, Sacha Earnest, and Shania Rawson will undoubtedly test her limits. Hastings, fresh off an impressive comeback season, Earnest, who finished the 2024 UCI DH season in 3rd place, and Rawson, recipient of the 2024 Crankworx Trail Blazer Award, bring local pride to the lineup. The Pump Track Challenge also introduces first-time Crankworx competitor and reigning UCI Pump Track World Champion Sabina Košárková from the Czech Republic, adding international intrigue to an already stacked field. Other notable names include Louise Ferguson, a multi-discipline powerhouse shifting from Freeride to Downhill racing, and Jordy Scott, who narrowly missed the 2024 Queen title and is poised for redemption. Male Athletes to Watch New Zealand’s dominance is palpable, with nearly a third of the confirmed male athletes hailing from Aotearoa. Lachie Stevens-McNab leads the charge after a breakout year, aiming to build on his RockShox Taniwha Downhill victory at Crankworx Rotorua 2024. Tuhoto-Ariki Pene, former King of Crankworx and Rotorua local, is joining him, eager to capitalize on ‘home turf’ advantage. International challengers include reigning King of Crankworx Ryan Gilchrist from Australia, who dominated the 2024 World Tour, his fellow countryman Jackson Frew, and British rider Bernard Kerr, bringing his signature style to the Redemption Downhill. Slopestyle Athletes to Look Out For Being the first of its calibre in Aotearoa, New Zealand, the FMB Gold Cup Slopestyle promises to deliver unforgettable moments. David Godziek, 2024 Slopestyle World Champion and Triple Crown winner, attends as the man to beat. Chasing him are heavy hitters from Europe like Erik Fedko and Lucas Huppert, as well as young Canadian talent like Griffin Paulson, Chance Moore, and Ben Thompson. The 2024 Red Bull Rookie of the Year and rising star Kaidan Ingersoll is poised to be a standout this season as he goes head-to-head with elite Crankworx Slopestyle World Championship (SWC) competitors. Red Bull athlete Patricia Druwen’s return after a 2024 hiatus sets the stage for fierce competition in the women's division. Joining her are SWC riders Canadian Natasha Miller and USA’s Shealen Reno, the first-ever female Slopestyle World Champion. Adding to the anticipation, the Christchurch Gold Cup Slopestyle will host first-time competitor Kirsten Van Horne from Canada. This promising dark horse has already showcased impressive skills and undeniable potential, setting the stage to disrupt the competition while carving out her place on the international circuit. Van Horne will also be vying for one of the coveted wildcards to the Maxxis Slopestyle at Crankworx Rotorua, adding an extra layer of stakes to her debut. Beyond the Races The festival kicks off on February 13 with a Jump Jam at CAP’s iconic Mulchy Jump, bringing local and international riders together in a spectacle of flips, whips, and style. This event also marks the beginning of a strong partnership between Crankworx and Christchurch, highlighting the city’s potential as a world-class mountain biking destination. After a day of race action, athletes and spectators can cycle into town and enjoy dinner at The Terrace , where they will find some of the city's best restaurants and bars, set along the Ōtākaro/Avon River. With its colourful, Spanish Mission-style architecture, New Regent Street is a hot tip, boasting an abundance of places to eat and drink in an amazing setting. Riverside Market is another favourite spot, with options for all tastes and temptations. Whether you’re a spectator, rider, or fan of the sport, Crankworx Summer Series Christchurch promises non-stop action and unforgettable moments of local talent rubbing shoulders with international top riders.

       "  \"Dario DiGiulio's 2025 Predictions: Behold, the visions of the seer. More radial tires. Schwalbe beat the competition to the punch with their radial tire release, but I don't think things will settle with that first release. The concept has legs, and the ride quality the tires offer seems to impress everyone that has a chance to ride them. As far as I understand it, the concept isn’t under patent protection, and can be iterated with various thread counts and casing approaches beyond the basic orientation change. I for one am stoked to see what the rubber wizards do with the idea over the next year or two. More downhill bikes. I think we’re going to see a few brands that historically haven’t offered a standalone downhill bike come to market with race bikes. My reasoning for this guess is as such: The DH World Cup is aiming to be a more premier and “important” series, with participants theoretically getting focused screen time and consistent results. That should encourage any brand with assets to spend to consider entering the ring, and offering their own ride for athletes to showcase. Add to that the supposedly democratized Continental series that the UCI has announced, and you’ll have a burgeoning market of aspiring racers looking for a solid race bike. DH bikes have never been a massive market, and of late if feels like most people are gravitating towards pedal-friendly machines, but this revised take on professional racing could stoke some competition on the brand end. Stronger brakes. The SRAM Mavens are the most powerful commonly available brakes on the market at this point, by some margin. Raw power isn’t the end-all be-all, but a high bar has been set for that one parameter, so I’d venture a guess that we’ll see more attempts at that accolade. Whether or not this is something you’re on the hunt for, I think the benefits come to light once you’ve had the chance to try something that can fundamentally change the way you approach braking, opening up new lines and speeds. Integrated complication. Last year I staked my claim on user-changeable frame stiffness being an increasingly common element on production bikes. While that didn’t catch on quite yet, I still think that’s on deck. I may be recycling from last year's list, but I still feel this one coming, so here's it is again.\",\n",
       "  \"Cannonball Mountain Bike Festival Kicks Off In Thredbo With Epic Racing Conditions: PRESS RELEASE: Cannonball MTB Festival The Cannonball Mountain Bike Festival, presented by Boost Mobile, is back for its eleventh year, and the action is already in full swing.

      "2 BC Bike Race Introduces New eMTB Categories For 2025 Event: Photo: Riders enjoy the trails at Maple Mountain in North Cowichan, BC, during the MegaVolt eMTB Festival, the first ebike event put on by BC Bike Race. PRESS RELEASE: BC Bike Race For the first time ever, the BC Bike Race has opened registration to e-bikers for the 2025 edition of the race. Remaining true to its roots as an innovator in the mountain bike events space, BCBR will be the first multi-day stage race in North America to launch an e-bike category. This follows on the heels of other international events, such as the Wines2Whales in South Africa and the Volcanic Epic in New Zealand. “This has been our minds for nearly 10 years since a few German racers asked us why we don’t have a category for eMTB. North America was then and still is about 10 years behind the European adoption of electric bikes. We believe it’s time to start including them in our event.” — Andreas Hestler, Co-founder and Marketing Director for BC Bike Race Dubbed the eBCBR, the new category will be open to both SL and full-power eMTBs and will run as a separate and concurrent event. This means the race will NOT mix electric and acoustic on the course at the same time and will create a schedule that gives both rider groups The Ultimate Singletrack Experience. There will also be an untimed option for those who want to ride the course without the pressure of a timing chip. The Journey to This Latest Evolution: BC Bike Race has always evolved alongside the Mountain Bike Industry. At our inception in 2007, the majority of bikes were aluminum hardtails with 26-inch wheels, and there wasn’t a dropper post in sight. Over time, carbon became the norm, full suspension took over, gear ratios grew, and good rubber started to hit the ground. As bikes evolved, the BCBR course has evolved, incorporating more singletrack and more technical terrain. BCBR gives racers the most, and arguably the best, singletrack of any stage race in the world. Now, there are eMountain Bikes. Embracing the history, growth and development of mountain biking, the BC Bike Race is evolving to give more people the chance to enjoy The Ultimate Singletrack Experience. More About the eBCBR: Date: June 30 – July 6th, 2025 Location: Vancouver Island – British Columbia Stage 1 – Victoria Stage 2 – Victoria Stage 3 – Cowichan Valley Stage 4 – Nanaimo Stage 5 – Cumberland Stage 6 – Campbell River Stage 7 – Cumberland BC Bike Race website Photo Credits : Dave Silver\n",
      "3 Event Report: The Inaugural Mt. Prevost DH Combine Invitational: Thank you to Stevie Smith Foundation, Municipality of North Cowichan, All-In Paramedic Services, all the pro riders, Aedan Skinner, Natalie Carrier, Oakley Salvisburg and all our volunteer course marshalls, and shuttle drivers for supporting the event and making it a success. Words by Holly Krasnuik and Darren Burns Photos by Jake Paddon and Natalie Carriere Video by Aedan Skinner What began years ago as a casual campfire chat between Canadian pro DH athletes McKay Vezina and Mark Wallace has now become a reality: Canada’s first-ever Downhill Mountain Bike Combine. The Cowichan Trail Stewardship Society in partnership with Stereo Racing hosted the first annual Downhill Mountain Bike Racing Combine Invitational on Mount Prevost in Duncan BC on November 1-3, 2024. Combines are a traditional method for teams and sports to find and develop new talent; which tests athletic skills such as speed, power, strength (mental and physical) and agility to identify future top players for the sport. The goal was to facilitate an event that would connect industry and unsigned U15-U17 Canadian riders in a meaningful, personal way that would result in a first hand learning experience about racing on the World Cup circuit. Parent participation was an integral portion of the event as we wanted to help facilitate an experience for supporting family members that helped garner awareness about the realistic expectations of what a professional career for their children encompasses. This year’s participants were 13 of BC’s fastest riders between the ages of 14 and 16 who have a goal of one day competing in the World Cup Circuit. These athletes were invited due to their performance at the 2024 BC/Canada Cups. The weekends events included: Friday: Meet and greet. Pro rider led Course inspection. Saturday: closed course practice on a taped course with 12 marshals on Mt.Prevost “Race Trail” Saturday evening: Q&A Panel with 8x industry professionals including UCI Team managers, nutritionist, Sports Physiotherapist, Performance coach and pro athletes. Sunday: Timed training and race run It was great to see how excited the riders and their families were to be there this weekend. It shows the value of what we are trying to do and already has us thinking about next year! — Mark Wallace Working with Holly and Mark on the Prevost Combine was a real privilege. As a trail society, being able to provide a platform and a trail for an event like this to take place is extremely rewarding. Our hope is that the Prevost Combine created a stepping stone for these extremely talented and dedicated kids to be able to take their riding careers to the next level. It was a pleasure connecting with the participants, their families, and all the volunteers that contributed time to this unique event. — Lorrie Mansey, CTSS Executive Director About the organizers: The Cowichan Trail Stewardship Society was founded and incorporated as a nonprofit organization in 2013 and currently builds, maintains and advocates for excellent mountain biking and hiking trails in the Cowichan Valley; namely on Mt Prevost, Mt Tzouhalem, and Maple Mountain. With more than a decade of industry experience, Stereo Racing is dedicated to coming up with creative solutions to amplify and enhance the meaningful impact and sustainable development of mountain biking both locally and globally.  We are committed to cultivating a pathway for Canadian athletes, nurturing their talent, and fostering a culture that embodies the heart of mountain bike culture in Canada. We strive to empower our team members by instilling values of perseverance, resilience, dedication, and self-respect, to not only excel in racing but also in life.

      "8 Dario DiGiulio's 2025 Predictions: Behold, the visions of the seer. More radial tires. Schwalbe beat the competition to the punch with their radial tire release, but I don't think things will settle with that first release. The concept has legs, and the ride quality the tires offer seems to impress everyone that has a chance to ride them. As far as I understand it, the concept isn’t under patent protection, and can be iterated with various thread counts and casing approaches beyond the basic orientation change. I for one am stoked to see what the rubber wizards do with the idea over the next year or two. More downhill bikes. I think we’re going to see a few brands that historically haven’t offered a standalone downhill bike come to market with race bikes. My reasoning for this guess is as such: The DH World Cup is aiming to be a more premier and “important” series, with participants theoretically getting focused screen time and consistent results. That should encourage any brand with assets to spend to consider entering the ring, and offering their own ride for athletes to showcase. Add to that the supposedly democratized Continental series that the UCI has announced, and you’ll have a burgeoning market of aspiring racers looking for a solid race bike. DH bikes have never been a massive market, and of late if feels like most people are gravitating towards pedal-friendly machines, but this revised take on professional racing could stoke some competition on the brand end. Stronger brakes. The SRAM Mavens are the most powerful commonly available brakes on the market at this point, by some margin. Raw power isn’t the end-all be-all, but a high bar has been set for that one parameter, so I’d venture a guess that we’ll see more attempts at that accolade. Whether or not this is something you’re on the hunt for, I think the benefits come to light once you’ve had the chance to try something that can fundamentally change the way you approach braking, opening up new lines and speeds. Integrated complication. Last year I staked my claim on user-changeable frame stiffness being an increasingly common element on production bikes. While that didn’t catch on quite yet, I still think that’s on deck. I may be recycling from last year's list, but I still feel this one coming, so here's it is again.\n",
      "9 Rotorua to Host First Round of UCI Pump Track World Championship Qualifiers: PRESS RELEASE: Graeme Simpson Photo: Dan Butterworth by Graeme Murray. The road to the Velosolutions UCI Pump Track World Championships in Switzerland in September will start in Rotorua, New Zealand on March 1. It’s a passion project for local Craig Pattle, a former world-class downhiller, still riding and now building pump tracks around his home country, Australia and Asia with Velosolutions NZ , including the venue for the initial quallie round. This track at the Waipa MTB trailhead was the product of a committed drive by the local community and years of hard work to get funding. Red Stag Timber donated the site...thanks, Paul Laing. Great friends of ours, Clair Scott from the Rotorua Trails Trust and Jude Eade helped with the process and Rotorua Trust, ONE Foundation, NZCT, Grass Roots and Grass Roots Central and TAB NZ came to the party.[/QUOTE] Video: bluedog media To have an international meet like this in our own backyard on a track we built...well, it’s a dream come true.

Velo Podcast: Sleeping with a Scorpion: An Interview with 2024 Tour Divide Winner Meaghan Hackinen Words - Mike Levy Some of you like to pedal up the hill. Some of you like to go down the hill. Some of you like to race your bike for a few hours. And some of you… Well, some of you like to race your bike for over 4,000 kilometres through sand, snow, hopefully, more than a little bit of sun, and everything else in between. Today, Mike Levy talks to Meaghan Hackinen. Meaghan won the 2024 Tour Divide, and she’s also a two-time 24-hour world-time trial champion, which sounds absolutely insane.

      "12 Race Report: New Zealand’s 2025 Enduro MTB National Championships: Words: Cable Bay Enduro The Cable Bay Enduro and New Zealand Enduro MTB National Championships took place over the weekend at the Cable Bay Adventure Park in Nelson, offering riders three exhilarating days of practice and racing under perfect weather conditions. The event, now in its sixth edition, featured eight challenging stages spread across two days, with a half-day of practice and racing on Saturday, followed by a full day of competition on Sunday. Saturday's action commenced with shuttled practice sessions on the initial stages, allowing riders to familiarise themselves with the terrain before tackling the first three timed stages later in the day. The atmosphere was electric, with participants ranging from first-time racers to seasoned professionals, all eager to make their mark on the national championship course. For racing, riders were given a short shuttle before pedalling through some of Cable Bay Adventure Park's most lush terrain. Stage one for this year was The Poacher, a new trail which opened for last year’s event. The trail includes a big rock roll, which this year claimed a few riders who were pushing hard to beat the clock. Stage 2 was a short but punchy stage, which had been left with minimal catches after practice. It was a fine line between getting through unscathed and pushing too hard and blowing corners out, with some finding the limit. To finish day 1 of racing riders descended Veto and were met by over 300+ spectators, many of whom were dressed up with the hope of winning the Soundboks Go speaker that was up for grabs. Sunday's full day of racing encompassed five additional stages, each presenting its own set of technical challenges and demanding terrains. Riders navigated a cumulative elevation gain of approximately 1600 meters over 30 kilometres and over 2000 metres of descents. The well-maintained trails of Cable Bay Adventure Park, combined with the favourable weather, provided ideal racing conditions. However, as the day went on, the heat began to take its toll. The opening stage for Day 2 was a brand new trail which opened for the event. The trail, named The Courthouse, certainly served up some challenges as riders descended deep into the valley floor. The Courthouse was not only the longest descent of the weekend, but it included the steepest sections as well. Following stage 4, riders were on their own with no more shuttle assistance. Stage 5 was a park favourite CCR into Lost Time, followed by Stage 6, Broken Gnome, Stage 7, Missing Link into Jurassic, before tackling the final Stage 8, PineIine. Crossing the finish line, riders were handed a cold refreshment thanks to the team at Two Thumb Brewery before watching the remainder of the field tackle the stage. As times were confirmed, riders enjoyed more refreshments and a buffet meal to conclude an epic weekend of riding. With the sun still shining, the awards ceremony was one to remember as riders, sponsors and volunteers were celebrated for all their efforts. The winners of the Under 19 and Elite divisions were as follows: Elite Men: 1st Place: Brady Stone (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Joe Millington 3rd Place: Lachie Ross Elite Women: 1st Place: Xanthe Robb (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Winni Goldsbury 3rd Place: Zoe Trolove Under 19 Men: 1st Place: Eli Robertson (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Nico Schroder 3rd Place: Seppy Binsbergen Under 19 Women: 1st Place: Lucy Kemp (NZ National Champ) 2nd Place: Iley Nunns Full results here The Cable Bay Enduro continues to solidify its reputation as a premier event on New Zealand's mountain biking calendar, offering riders of all levels an opportunity to compete in a professionally organized and challenging environment. The success of this year's championships underscores the dedication of the organizers, volunteers, and sponsors in promoting the growth and recognition of Enduro mountain biking in New Zealand. For 2026, The Cable Bay Enduro will once more take place at Cable Bay Adventure Park and will certainly be an event not to miss as the organizers have some exciting plans taking shape. The reins for the National Championships, however, will be passed on to whom we have yet to find out! Photo credit thanks to Digby Shaw & Rory Stock\n",

      "15 Race Report: Crankworx Rotorua Ends with a Bang After New Courses & New Challenges: Crankworx Rotorua 2025 wrapped up with high-speed head-to-head action at the Specialized Dual Slalom, as athletes tackled a brand-new, repurposed Speed & Style course at Skyline Rotorua. The challenging terrain and uncertain bike choice made for an intense day of racing, pushing riders to their limits. Caroline Buchanan Takes Gold Over Jordy Scott In the women’s final, former Queen of Crankworx, Caroline Buchanan faced Jordy Scott in a dramatic battle. Scott held a 0.237-second advantage going into the second run, but Buchanan’s acceleration in the final flat section proved too strong, allowing her to clinch victory. Adding to her remarkable win, Buchanan was forced to race on an unfamiliar bike after her Dual Slalom bike was stolen just a week before arriving in Rotorua. “This course was so technical. Shark fin features that really threw a different element to the racing today”, Caroline Buchanan about the new course. The small final saw Pump Track Champion Sabina Košárková grab her second bronze medal of the festival, after also finishing third in the Pump Track Challenge earlier this week. In her first-ever Crankworx Dual Slalom, Košárková defeated young Canadian Slopestyle standout Natasha Miller, who slipped on the final left-hand berm, sealing Košárková’s podium spot. Women’s Top 5: 1. Caroline Buchanan (AUS) 2. Jordy Scott (USA) 3. Sabina Košárková (CZE) 4. Natasha Miller (CAN) 5. Laura Smulders (NED) Ryan Gilchrist Defends 2024 Victory In a nail-biting gold medal battle against Sam Blenkinsop, Ryan Gilchrist emerged victorious despite a tricky first run where he nearly missed the final gates. Gilchrist came back strong, laying down the fastest time of the day at 19.961 seconds - a significant gap over the second-fastest run by Tuhoto-Ariki Pene (20.305s). With this, he secured back-to-back victories in Rotorua, defending his 2024 Specialized Dual Slalom gold and once again displayed his prowess and pedal power. Kiwi rider Sam Blenkinsop showcased that after several years of racing within the Crankworx circuit, he is still a force to be reckoned with and not to be counted out of the battle for the 2025 crown. In the bronze medal match, Gilchrist’s YETI teammate Richie Rude faced off against local hero and 2023 King of Crankworx, Tuhoto-Ariki Pene. Pene, in a dramatic turn, missed the final gates and was disqualified, awarding Rude with a bronze medal in his first-ever Crankworx Dual Slalom. Men’s Podium: 1. Ryan Gilchrist (AUS) 2. Sam Blenkinsop (NZL) 3. Richie Rude (USA) 4. Tuhoto-Ariki Pene (NZL) 5. Tegan Cruz (CAN) Full results here .

      "17 Ready to Ride: Crankworx Summer Series New Zealand Kicks Off the 2025 Season: PRESS RELEASE: Crankworx Mountain biking enthusiasts, mark your calendars: from February 13-16, Crankworx Summer Series New Zealand will transform Ōtautahi Christchurch into the epicentre of gravity-fueled excitement. Against the breathtaking setting of Christchurch Adventure Park (CAP), riders from across the globe are set to converge for four days of high-stakes competition featuring three main events: Redemption Downhill, Pump Track Challenge, and New Zealand’s first-ever FMB Gold Cup Slopestyle. While athlete registration remains open, the early rider list is already stacked with a mix of international stars and local heroes, promising an adrenaline-charged showcase of skill and determination. For the first time, athletes have the opportunity to earn valuable points towards the prestigious Crankworx World Tour Series and the coveted King & Queen of Crankworx titles by competing in the Pump Track Challenge and Redemption Downhill, solidifying the festival’s significance on the global mountain bike stage. Spectators can catch all the action live on-site or watch the broadcast live on TV NZ or Pinkbike while aspiring competitors still have a chance to grab a spot before registration closes. Female Athletes to Watch The reigning Queen of Crankworx, Martha Gill, is among the top contenders heading to Christchurch. Gill’s skill in both the Downhill and Pump Track disciplines makes her a favourite, though competition from Kiwi stars like Jenna Hastings, Sacha Earnest, and Shania Rawson will undoubtedly test her limits. Hastings, fresh off an impressive comeback season, Earnest, who finished the 2024 UCI DH season in 3rd place, and Rawson, recipient of the 2024 Crankworx Trail Blazer Award, bring local pride to the lineup. The Pump Track Challenge also introduces first-time Crankworx competitor and reigning UCI Pump Track World Champion Sabina Košárková from the Czech Republic, adding international intrigue to an already stacked field. Other notable names include Louise Ferguson, a multi-discipline powerhouse shifting from Freeride to Downhill racing, and Jordy Scott, who narrowly missed the 2024 Queen title and is poised for redemption. Male Athletes to Watch New Zealand’s dominance is palpable, with nearly a third of the confirmed male athletes hailing from Aotearoa. Lachie Stevens-McNab leads the charge after a breakout year, aiming to build on his RockShox Taniwha Downhill victory at Crankworx Rotorua 2024. Tuhoto-Ariki Pene, former King of Crankworx and Rotorua local, is joining him, eager to capitalize on ‘home turf’ advantage. International challengers include reigning King of Crankworx Ryan Gilchrist from Australia, who dominated the 2024 World Tour, his fellow countryman Jackson Frew, and British rider Bernard Kerr, bringing his signature style to the Redemption Downhill. Slopestyle Athletes to Look Out For Being the first of its calibre in Aotearoa, New Zealand, the FMB Gold Cup Slopestyle promises to deliver unforgettable moments. David Godziek, 2024 Slopestyle World Champion and Triple Crown winner, attends as the man to beat. Chasing him are heavy hitters from Europe like Erik Fedko and Lucas Huppert, as well as young Canadian talent like Griffin Paulson, Chance Moore, and Ben Thompson. The 2024 Red Bull Rookie of the Year and rising star Kaidan Ingersoll is poised to be a standout this season as he goes head-to-head with elite Crankworx Slopestyle World Championship (SWC) competitors. Red Bull athlete Patricia Druwen’s return after a 2024 hiatus sets the stage for fierce competition in the women's division. Joining her are SWC riders Canadian Natasha Miller and USA’s Shealen Reno, the first-ever female Slopestyle World Champion. Adding to the anticipation, the Christchurch Gold Cup Slopestyle will host first-time competitor Kirsten Van Horne from Canada. This promising dark horse has already showcased impressive skills and undeniable potential, setting the stage to disrupt the competition while carving out her place on the international circuit. Van Horne will also be vying for one of the coveted wildcards to the Maxxis Slopestyle at Crankworx Rotorua, adding an extra layer of stakes to her debut. Beyond the Races The festival kicks off on February 13 with a Jump Jam at CAP’s iconic Mulchy Jump, bringing local and international riders together in a spectacle of flips, whips, and style. This event also marks the beginning of a strong partnership between Crankworx and Christchurch, highlighting the city’s potential as a world-class mountain biking destination. After a day of race action, athletes and spectators can cycle into town and enjoy dinner at The Terrace , where they will find some of the city's best restaurants and bars, set along the Ōtākaro/Avon River. With its colourful, Spanish Mission-style architecture, New Regent Street is a hot tip, boasting an abundance of places to eat and drink in an amazing setting. Riverside Market is another favourite spot, with options for all tastes and temptations.
